The controls take a bit of getting used to but after that you'll be flying through the air slaughtering titans in no time.\n\nThere's a bunch of different game modes and a lot of ways to upgrade not only your main character but all the characters from the anime as well. Between each game mode it pretty much covers the whole story.\n\nIf you enjoyed the anime you should definitely give the game a try!", 0.6986302733421326], ["This Yeager guy is pretty chill.

What I enjoyed the most was reliving the most epic anime scenes in high-quality CGI with the original voice actors. It really brought the story to life, especially with my own Scout character added into the mix. \n\nThe pacing through the main storyline is excellent and the voice acting absolutely stellar. It doesn't bring anything new but feels more like a much welcomed refresher on the Masterpiece that is the writing of Attack On Titan through seasons 1-2. \n\n(And season 3 if you get the DLC but it's not as good as the main game due to lack of CGI cut scenes, no hub and no custom character)", 0.523809552192688], ["If you watched the anime, you already know what to expect in gameplay-wise enemy type for the rest of your time (unless you get in DLC and fight humans for a tad bit).

I think the coolest thing is that the company had to almost reanimate scenes from the show and make it cut-scenes in 3d!\r\nAnd it is sooo much better than the 1st game! Customizable characters, bigger story, and much more!\r\nI love this game and I will glaze it to the maximum.", 0.5], ["Fun Gameplay Loop (Probably gets boring after a while....still waiting for that while to hit) -> Check\nInserting Yourself into Your Favorite Anime -> Check\nMore Features Than You'd Ever Expect for an Anime Adaptation -> Check\nCo-Op and Online Versus -> Check\nODM Gear That Makes You Feel Like Spiderman -> Check\n\nWhat more could you want?
