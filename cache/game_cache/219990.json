If what you are looking for in an ARPG is build variety, replayability, and tons of meaningful loot, this game is for you. Don't bother with the bigger names out there. Crate has actively supported this game for 9 years (it looks great) and still has a major expansion on the horizon. This is not an MMO which means no microtransactions, no wonky action house economy, no shifting meta. You can still play multiplayer with up to three of your friends, though (similar to the old Torchlight II). The best part of the game is all the builds work. You won't have to look up some 500 skill point allocation guide to religiously follow (did I mention respec is dirt cheap :).

Live service model games need to continually make decisions based on what will sell microtransactions - sometimes that means having players do chores to keep them in-game, sometimes it means limited inventory and stash space to sell \"quality of life\" microtransactions, sometimes it means more aggressive advertising. There's none of that here and it's very refreshing. I get the sense that nearly every decision made by the team is purely devoted to making the player experience the best it can possibly be while retaining all of the classic appeal of a good loot and class-based ARPG. The team doesn't compromise because they don't have to. Power fantasies are in full effect, gearing is fun, endgame is great, and if I ever get tired of any of this you can bet I'll start modding the crap out of this game.", 0.5922746658325195], ["One of my favorites.

The combat feels visceral and satisfying, with tons of build diversity thanks to the dual-class system and epic loot. The dark, gritty atmosphere is immersive, and the world design is packed with secrets and lore.\n\nCompared to Path of Exile 2, Grim Dawn is just so much more engaging. POE2 feels sluggish and overly complicated, with slow combat that drains the fun out of grinding. Grim Dawn, on the other hand, keeps the action intense and progression meaningful without unnecessary bloat.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the funny thing\u2014you don\u2019t even realize how good Grim Dawn is until you try POE2. After slogging through POE2\u2019s clunky pacing and tedious mechanics, you suddenly appreciate Grim Dawn\u2019s smooth combat, rewarding loot system, and player-friendly design.

The gameplay loop didn\u2019t evolve much, which made progression feel a bit monotonous as time went on.\n\nThe early game also felt particularly slow, with a sluggish progression curve that made it harder to stay engaged from the outset.\n\nI didn\u2019t enjoy the camera controls or field of vision either\u2014it felt more restrictive compared to other ARPGs I\u2019ve played. Tree canopies and building facades often obscure visibility to the point where I found myself wrestling with the camera more than focusing on the actual gameplay.\n\nVisually, the game\u2019s graphics feel quite dated, and while functional, they don\u2019t do much to elevate the experience.\n\nI\u2019ll likely finish my current playthrough with my first character and might check out the DLC quests, but I don\u2019t see myself rushing to do another run with a different character.", 0.5032258033752441], ["Excellent game that offers potential to make a vast amount of unique and viable builds.", 0.501069188117981], ["The world design is interesting and there are a ton of possible builds, but they all end up taking forever to get into and you end up spamming the same 2-3 abilities.
