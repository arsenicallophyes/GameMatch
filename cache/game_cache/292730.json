The zero-g combat and tech is really interesting, and the art design is excellent. The fighter combat is not my thing; it feels like that one space mission in Halo Reach. The story is a mixed bag -- there are some cool characters like Ethan and Omar but the villain is pretty stupid and cartoonishly evil without good motivation. I think Killzone did the whole \"colonists vs. Earth\" conflict in a more nuanced way, where the Helghast actually have valid reasons for hating the ISA. Also, whenever your companions die, it is in a stupid way which was easily avoided but is still in the game to force an emotional response. I can see why COD fans wouldn't like this game, but then they complained about this and got the most boring game in the franchise (WW2), so that's something. At least now you can assassinate your enemies with a farting unicorn wearing a Nicki Minaj skin in le heckin realistic boots-on-the-ground modern COD.", 0.5], ["one of the best games ever made, and also better than treyarch zombies in a few ways. (i'm not hating, i am just saying... it is true sorry.) \n\ninfinite warfare has an amazing zombies mode, with tons of things to do on each map, easter eggs that are fun to do, it has 5 cool celebrity characters that you can unlock,  it was made with a vision in mind, and with love too.\n\n  it has a couple of really good weapons thanks to the variants.(you can earn keys and salvage just by playing, no need to spend money.)  \n\n and a really good reward for beating every easter egg for the first time,  with added Replay value on top of that by doing all that again with directors cut on.\n\nthe fate and fortune cards system is better than the gobblecums 100%, it's not even close.\n\nplus all of the maps are good, yes even beast from beyond (tho it could have been more, just imagine if they were given more time.)\n\nmy only 2 small nitpicks are: i wish the characters had way more voicelines, and i wish the fov was done better cause it doesn't feel that high.

No records, no medals, no rescue protocol. Just a dead-drop order handed to a fireteam of ghosts. If they failed, no one would even know to care.\n\nLieutenant Lex Navarro, callsign Specter-1, was the team lead. A former Jovian mining enforcer turned SATO spec-ops, Navarro had been forged in low-G riots and hardened through a decade of dirty war. He didn't care about medals or ranks\u2014just finishing the job.\n\nWhen the Settlement Defense Front burned Geneva from orbit, Navarro was already in enemy territory\u2014buried beneath the surface of an SDF-controlled asteroid near Europa, deep inside a converted mining facility that had become a weapons test site.\n\nTheir mission was surgical: infiltrate, locate a new prototype kinetic weapon, and destroy it before it could be launched.\n\nThey inserted during a solar flare blackout, using the magnetic shadows of the asteroid's rotation to slip past orbital scans. No eyes on them. No backup. Just boots, breath, and silence.\n\nInside the base, something felt wrong. Not quiet\u2014hollow. Lights flickered. Power systems were in standby. The air was cold and thick with the scent of ozone and synthetic oil. The SDF weren\u2019t patrolling. They didn\u2019t need to.\n\nMotion pings started to flutter across their HUDs. Navarro raised a fist, halting the squad. Harris, his recon tech, tapped into the local spectrum. \u201cNo drones. These aren\u2019t bots,\u201d he whispered.\n\nThen the wall behind him opened.\n\nThey weren\u2019t drones\u2014they were sentries. SDF had built AI-integrated exo-suits\u2014machine-hybrids with humanoid forms and infrared camouflage. Silent. Adaptive. Built to kill.\n\nHarris died fast. His scream never even fully formed.\n\nNavarro dropped one with a short burst to the processor core. Monroe took down another with a thermite spike. The rest of the squad set a fast retreat into the deeper levels.\n\nThe mission had changed.\n\nTime was bleeding out.\n\nThey fought through gravity shifts, server vaults, and an abandoned crew sector that had been sealed and scrubbed\u2014too clean. Every hallway echoed with static. By the time they reached the weapon chamber, only Navarro and Monroe were still breathing.\n\nThe Helios Lance looked like something out of nightmare theory: a railgun the size of a freight train, magnetically stabilized, tied into a crude launch cradle on a tethered orbital loop. It was set to fire in 22 minutes.\n\nNavarro assessed the situation. The control AI was locked. The core was sealed. Too many failsafes.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t disable it,\u201d he muttered. \u201cWe ride it.\u201d\n\nMonroe blinked. \u201cYou serious?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been more.\u201d\n\nThey climbed onto the exterior chassis of the Lance, wired a backdoor into the manual ignition, and preprogrammed a magnetic destabilization. If they triggered it just right, the weapon would fire with no payload, burn out its core mid-flight, and tear itself apart in the vacuum.\n\nAs the countdown hit thirty seconds, SDF sentries breached the chamber. Monroe laid down suppressing fire and got hit\u2014bad. Navarro dragged him up onto the structure, slammed the last command in, and they launched.\n\nThe Lance screamed through the void. Twenty seconds in, the coil fried. It began to tear itself apart. Monroe lost his grip and spiraled off into blackness. Navarro clamped down, silent, as the whole weapon cracked apart around him.\n\nLater, a SATO patrol drone picked up a faint beacon\u2014barely more than a whisper, wrapped in static and ice. Navarro was floating in the wreckage, suit shredded, left hand gone, visor webbed with cracks. Still breathing.\n\nThey never asked what happened.\n\nThey never mentioned Helios Lance in any official report.\n\nBut it never fired.\n\nAnd the planet never felt its wrath.\n\nSomewhere in the shadows of space, a silent mission had saved millions. And only one man remembered.", 0.5454545617103577], ["haters gonna hate but fr just give it a try u weirdos\r\nps. zombies", 0.5487105846405029]]}, "images": {"header_image": "https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/292730/header.jpg?t=1646764561", "capsule_image": "https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/292730/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1646764561", "capsule_image_v5": "https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/292730/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1646764561"}, "support": {"support_website": null, "support_email": null, "game_website": "https://www.callofduty.com/infinitewarfare"}, "developer": "Infinity Ward", "owners": "1,000,000 .. 2,000,000", "tags": ["Action", "FPS", "Multiplayer", "Zombies", "Space", "Futuristic", "Shooter", "Hero Shooter", "First-Person", "Singleplayer", "Sci-fi", "Robots", "Adventure", "Story Rich", "Atmospheric", "Quick-Time Events", "War", "Great Soundtrack", "Co-op", "Post-apocalyptic"], "languages": ["English", " French", " Italian", " German", " Spanish - Spain", " Japanese", " Korean", " Polish", " Portuguese - Brazil", " Russian", " Simplified Chinese", " Traditional Chinese"], "concurrent_plays": 199, "number_of_achievements": 88, "categories": ["Single-player", "Multi-player", "PvP", "Online PvP", "Co-op", "Online Co-op", "Steam Achievements", "Full controller support", "Valve Anti-Cheat enabled", "Remote Play on TV", "Family Sharing"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "short_description": "Infinite Warfare delivers three unique game modes: Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies.", "long_description": null}
