By slowly taking away survival features, contorting it update by update slowly pulling it apart, taking away features and over-simplifying mechanics they remove any resemblance of realistic sandbox survival, replacing it with arcadey RPG elements. Below is a relatively short list of ways the game has completely dissolved from what it once was\n\n-You can no longer fill jars with water to boil, you have to \"quest\" in order to obtain the materials for a 'dew collecter' which is the only way to collect water from nature.\n-You no longer gain skills in the relevant category (mining = mining xp), instead like in an rpg, you can freely choose to use your skill points however you wish. Bashing zombies means you'll be a world renown chef in no time!\n-You now have to clear POI's aka Dungeons to get anywhere in the game, oh and just to be sure it's a REAL RPG, it even has a difficulty meter neatly placed on top of your screen, giving you META knowledge on whether or not it's too difficult for you. This also gives the player a very nice RPG way of knowing if the POI is even worth their time, as the difficulty scales loot.\n-You also HAVE to complete quests now, that is if you want to get anywhere in the game. Yes, the hallmark of the RPG, questing... unless you actively quest for the traders, you'll be stunted in your progress and will have a hard time getting anywhere. Oh, and when you're done you'll be rewarded with 'gold', 'skill books' and 'loot'. God I love having to run errands in my survival game, it really immerses you in that zombie apocalypse vibe.\n-You'll now need to complete many of these quests, because the only way to reliably gain skill books (which is the only real way to unlock new crafting recipes for tools and equipment) is by questing for them, thus soft-locking progression behind the questing system.\n-You liked being able to customise your character to your liking with a broad range of gear? Well that's too bad, because this game wants to be an RPG, so now you only get 4 slots where you can put VERY specific pre-made outfits, and there will be no customisation, because 'outfits' give buffs when you have the entire set, again, soft-locking character customisation.\n-Did somebody say RPG? Well, where are the potions? Oh there they are, disguised as 'candies'. They act exactly like potions, granting the player magical powers like increased resource gain, experience and loot boosts. You can buy these potions from the trader, where they'll be waiting neatly packaged in a vending machine, straight from the post-apocalypse candy factory.\n-And together with this it's also been decided that every dungeon should have a pre-determined path. Instead of looking through houses, scavenging every room and looking for hidden items, the game should feel like an RPG, and everyone knows that a dungeon needs a clear path to follow and a nice big loot room at the end, so that's what they did. Houses and other POI's now have a neatly placed hole in the wall or open door etc. that holds your hand as you traverse through the dungeon, leading you to the price at the end of it, all without having to smash a single door and all stacked together so that there's no mistaking it. \n\nAgain, this is just what popped up in my head, there's loads of other changes that either made the game a horrible sandbox survival game, or helped turn it into an RPG. I feel sad, this game used to be amazing, now you're forced to play the game how the devs want you to play it. I mean they even removed the Sandbox tag on Steam\n\nShame on you Fun Pimps\n\n\n", 0.9024150371551514], ["The concept is that at some point, there was a serious disaster.  Now, every 7 days the moon turns red and hordes of zombies come to try to kill you.  Further, zombies are everywhere, usually moving slower during the day and faster at night.  They hunt you if you get close enough.  Otherwise the world is our world with the standard day night cycles, nature etc\u2026 Well, at least that was the original concept of the game..   \n\nIt used to be a logical open world that was tough to survive in but the physics and requirements for survival and crafting was the same as IRL.  You could learn the basics by doing and better stuff by finding specialist books that covered that subject. Sadly, that is not the case anymore.  Now you have to find magazines, lots of magazines. \n\nYou used to be able to make weapons, progressing in a logical way from stone clubs and stick bows and arrows and spears to a pipe blunderbuss with pebbles for ammo to a single shot pipe shotgun with real shot to pipe revolvers to pipe machine guns with very small mags to better versions of each until you got up to m60\u2019s and sniper rifles and compound bows.   Now, well now you can make a pipe machine gun, with that complicated machine gun firing mechanic on day one, no magazines required.  But don\u2019t worry you won\u2019t be able to cook anything and grass clothing is all you can make too.  How does that make sense? \n\nYou used to be able to make armor pieces of different types and jumble them together to get the type of armor coverage and movement you wanted. The armor you made even looked like you had patched stuff together to make them.  Now you have \u201cSets\u201d. Each piece gives you some magical special ability and if you have the whole set there are magical set abilities.  They don\u2019t say it\u2019s magical but in practice it clearly is. I mean really?\n\nThere was a logical progression of building from simple wood to reinforced wood to stone to reinforced stone to cement to rebar reinforced cement to steel.  Not so much now. \n\nCrafting was first do it to learn it, then became perk based (experience let you learn stuff), and now became you don\u2019t know jack and can\u2019t learn jack and thus can\u2019t craft jack, (or cook jack), UNLESS you find enough magazines on the subject.  Specialist books do still exist to provide extra\u2019s.  But wait\u2026 you can still make that pipe machine gun right off the bat, and you can still build wood buildings\u2026\u2026 No magazines required. This makes sense why? \n\nThe natural world used to follow the rules of nature.  That is, you could melt and then boil snow to make potable water; you could gather water from streams and lakes to boil so you could drink it safely; you could even drink water from the lakes or streams in a pinch and hope you didn\u2019t get sick.  You could find wild berries, (Snow berries), in abundance in the snow biome to survive on for a bit.  Yes, there was a small chance they would make you sick too but that was usually better than starving.  Now, well now you can\u2019t melt snow nor gather water from lakes or streams. The only way to get water is via a Dew Collector.. yeah. Hope you find those magazines you need fast so you can figure out how to build it.  Wonder what wildlife uses?  Well, you could always buy water from a vending machine or trader.  Oh yes, you can also hope to find something to drink in a zombie infested house or building\u2026 \n\n\nZombies.  Zombies used to behave logically for a zombie.  They would wonder around until they spotted someone and then they\u2019d try to go eat that someone.  Sometimes they would try to eat the wildlife and/or fight wildlife. They could fall \u201casleep\u201d or comatose in buildings and could wake up if disturbed.  During a blood moon, they would become stronger and crazed and KNEW where you were and came in a horde to get you.    Now, well it\u2019s a bit different.  Now zombies wall themselves into walls, ceilings, you name it and wait for you.  Now, they can appear, literally out of thin air if you step on the software coded \u201ctrigger\u201d block or area.  Stealth or no stealth, that trigger block still creates the zombies and they will all agro on you. \n \nQuests:  At first, quests didn\u2019t even exist.  Now, well now they are your life blood.  They are how you reset buildings you already cleared of zombies and loot.  They are how you get that money you need to buy those special books you can\u2019t find, from the trader or those crafting centers (Forge, cement mixer, etc), you haven\u2019t found the magazines for yet.  What about a nice gun or extra ammo or, early on, the basics.. Food and water.   Doesn\u2019t feel so much like an open survival world when you have to go to a quest provider all the time. BTW, the quests are limited in that they repeat.  You end up doing the same quest at the same buildings, over and over and over and\u2026 \n\nTraders:  It used to be a specific trader could be in a forest zone in one area and a desert in another etc.  They were not tied to a specific biome.  Now they are and that, my friends, is simply sad.  I say this because the traders are not generic, they have their own personalities and to some extent specialties. So now you are Forced to go to a specific biome to find that trader you like.  They simply won\u2019t exist in any of the other biomes. \n\nStory line:  The game starts out with an interesting storyline beginning teaser, which is also alluded to by at least one of the traders in one of their statements to you.  Yet, as of this writing, April 2025, no story has emerged.  This is sad to me as it seems such a story could be easily put together, especially with the quest system in place. \n\nLastly, even after all these years in development, the basic block on block building problem remains.  The ground blocks have a different orientation than the above ground building blocks.  They don\u2019t mesh smoothly.  So, when you are trying to build say a driveway, you end up with an entry slope block that does not smoothly go to the ground of the next block.  Rather, there is either a ledge or a deep crack between the blocks that bikes and motorcycles usually can\u2019t cross and other wheeled vehicles may or may not cross with a significant bump and resulting vehicle damage.  \n\nFor me, this has been a sad downhill ride.  I was so excited at the beginning, everything was logical to me and natural.  Now it\u2019s all contrived and not at all realistic in the game play on even the basics.   \n\n\n", 0.69565749168396], ["Was a great game during its many alpha stages and has come a long way with performance and content. \nBut the game since going into 1.0 has suffered with an identity crisis between being an open ended survival game like it used to be and a linear RPG in the sense that you are expected to play how the devs want you to play instead of playing how you would like.", 0.6057491898536682], ["The devs have no idea what they want to do with a game.\r\n\r\nIt went from an Open Sandbox Survival game to an RPG Sandbox Survival game where your options to approach things have been severely reduced and u won't get better at X thing by doing it.

U must choose a class, which also limits what weapons u can use properly. U want to use clubs & Shotguns? Go for Strength, but wait... This Rifle & SMG are really good, also this pistol is quite nice... Now you must spec into Rifles, SMG & Pistols which all have different trees & point requirements in their respective category... But damn, I also need to spec into faster digging, faster mining, electricity, crafting, workbenches, vehicles, fuel, chemistry, medicine, Quest rewards, Quest EXP, Faster looting, Better rewards, Better loot rewards... Damn... Where my points go? Why am I so weak? Go figure... Stick with a main build and main weapons for one playthrough otherwise forget it, if u want other quality of life things. Use mods or edit the files for more points per level\r\n\r\nYou can find what u need to progress on either day 1 or Day 20, thank you RNG and RPG elements.

Grab a quest, go to a Quest Marker on the map, click on it when u get there, now follow the ,,Dungeon\" aka the Building u arrived by going through the loops that the devs hand crafted for you, for each building.
