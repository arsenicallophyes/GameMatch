There's a ton of different stages and usually different ways to go about solving them. The physics will make you giggle and the silly shenanigans you can get into with friends makes multiplayer feel very rewarding. The controls take a bit to get used to but that just adds to the madness.", 0.6169668436050415], ["This game is HILARIOUS. Grab a group of friends and play it together!", 0.5419847369194031], ["Great game full of puzzle and that kind of stuff,u need to use 100% of ur brain in game and think,fire game i recoment it! :D", 0.5364238619804382], ["The local split-screen implementation with mixed inputs (Keyboard/Mouse + Controller) is incredibly frustrating and unreliable. Trying to get Player 1 on KBM and Player 2 on a controller is a nightmare. More often than not, as soon as the second player joins with the controller, the keyboard and mouse input for the first player completely stops working.\r\n\r\nOn the rare occasion - truly, once in a blue moon - that you actually manage to get it working, the game is an absolute blast. It's genuinely fun, silly physics-based gameplay that's great for both adults and kids alike. The potential for local co-op laughs is huge.\r\n\r\nHowever, that potential is completely overshadowed by the sheer inconsistency and hassle of just getting the split-screen to function correctly. Seeing how rarely it cooperates, I simply can't be bothered to fight with the setup anymore. It's a shame, because the core game is enjoyable, but this persistent technical issue ruins the local co-op experience for me.\r\n\r\nCannot recommend if your primary goal is local split-screen with KBM and a controller.", 0.5127537846565247], ["Human: Fall Flat is a delightful and quirky puzzle-platformer that delivers tons of fun with its physics-based gameplay. The wobbly, customizable characters and the comical ragdoll physics make every puzzle and interaction feel entertaining. Whether you're solving puzzles solo or teaming up with friends in co-op, there\u2019s always a sense of hilarity as you try (and often fail) to navigate through the environments.\r\n\r\nThe game features a wide variety of creative levels, each with its own set of challenges that require both problem-solving and a good sense of humor. The open-ended nature of the puzzles means there\u2019s no one right way to complete them, giving players the freedom to experiment and explore different solutions.\r\n\r\nWith its charming art style, fun mechanics, and lots of opportunities for laughter, Human: Fall Flat is a fantastic game for anyone looking to have a good time, whether on your own or with friends. It\u2019s a lighthearted experience that\u2019s both amusing and rewarding.", 0.5], ["these game controls are great.
