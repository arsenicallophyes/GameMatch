On the flip side, the gameplay is kinda dated. There were a lot of rough edges in the quality of life - for example, finding the matches for the sky in the puzzle was brutal. (The pieces have two shapes, and the color in the pieces doesn't match the color once they're placed, so you mostly have to brute force it.) And, some games are pretty painful, like the flappy-bird adjacent games controlled by mouse buttons. Other puzzles are fairly derivative; we've done them before. I was pretty annoyed by these things untillll I saw the game is 15 years old.\n\nI played this game while home sick. If you want, a slow and peaceful puzzle experience, where you don't need the crispest gameplay, this will deliver. Its strongest point is the ~~vibes~~ with lovely art and soundtracking, and that's a lovely place to just drift for a while.", 0.523809552192688], ["A really good game to play together with your family", 0.5], ["i first played it in 2019 , now it's full of nostalgia\r\n\r\n", 0.5], ["Boring tedious garbage.", 0.3790678381919861]]}, "images": {"header_image": "https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/96000/header.jpg?t=1631292999", "capsule_image": "https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/96000/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1631292999", "capsule_image_v5": "https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/96000/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1631292999"}, "support": {"support_website": null, "support_email": null, "game_website": "http://www.colibrigames.com"}, "developer": "Colibri Games", "owners": "5,000,000 .. 10,000,000", "tags": ["Puzzle", "Point & Click", "Hand-drawn", "Steampunk", "Retro", "Atmospheric", "2D", "Story Rich", "Casual", "Family Friendly", "Cute", "Surreal", "Stylized", "Adventure", "Hidden Object", "Singleplayer", "Indie", "Minigames", "Logic", "Relaxing"], "languages": ["English", " Russian", " French", " Italian", " German", " Spanish - Spain", " Bulgarian", " Czech", " Danish", " Dutch", " Finnish", " Greek", " Hungarian", " Japanese", " Korean", " Norwegian", " Polish", " Portuguese - Portugal", " Portuguese - Brazil", " Romanian", " Simplified Chinese", " Swedish", " Thai", " Traditional Chinese", " Turkish", " Ukrainian", " Arabic"], "concurrent_plays": 5, "number_of_achievements": null, "categories": ["Single-player", "Steam Trading Cards", "Family Sharing"], "genres": ["Adventure", "Casual", "Indie"], "short_description": "Life on Tiny Planet was calm and carefree until a great disaster occurred - Tiny Planet was hit by a meteor!
