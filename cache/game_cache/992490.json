It is worse than other options available, for free or fee, and requires no less tinkering.  The developer is super-toxic and spends his time visiting reviews to tell the reviewer why criticism isn't deserved instead of actually trying to provide a better experience.  There's one guy on the Steam forums he verbally attacked for having a negative review on the Google Play store.  In my case, the XBox One controller doesn't work for the VR-version of Steam (VR Home, etc) and instead of offering up workarounds or his experience or pointing me at a FAQ or anything the obnoxious chap instead vented about how his software was worth way more than I paid and that it wasn't his fault the user-experience was poor and that I should call him daddy, etc. etc.  The reality is, I don't care if it's his fault or not.  The experience of using his software (and his support) was very poor and I cannot recommend it to anyone at any price.  If you have the time to tinker and troubleshoot, go with free options supported by helpful communities.  Definitely skip this product.", 0.43130719661712646], ["This software is a blast to use!

Easy to setup, works flawlessly over WiFi and wired USB connection (via iTunes, I recommend this method, as you can really jack the performance and quality settings up).\nI use it with a \u00a35 Google Cardboard (literally!) headset from Amazon, and my favoured racing sims work perfectly - Project CARS2, Assetto Corsa etc. I can easily read the text on HUD's and car clocks, and the fps is smooth.\n\nI had one problem in setup (my Bonjour service was not running on Windows 10) - I emailed support on a Sunday afternoon, and got a reply an hour later, that sorted it. Top class service.\n\nI also have a PSVR headset, so I reckon I will be trying the driver for that as well!
