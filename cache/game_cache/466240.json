It creates a great atmosphere for the scenarios that transpire through the match with you and the other players with 2 (infected) trying to 'play innocent' with 5 other survivors.  It's a test of wits and cunning, and seeing if you can outsmart your buds.\n\nI don't know why the playerbase for this game sunk, there's not much wrong with it, and it deserves a way better fan base.

Two out of the six players are infected and must kill the innocent players before they escape. The innocent players must escape the Game Masters arena while simultaneously trying to figure who the two infected players are.\n\nThis type of game is a classic \"who is my enemy and who is my friend\" because you truly cannot trust anyone in this game no matter what they say or do.\n\n**CONS**\n- Game sometimes lags in certain areas of the maps\n- As of now, 3/21/2017, there are only two maps and they get boring pretty fast\n- Cameras are WAY too powerful against the infected when they are in Terror Form\n- Asian players invade the NA servers so you may get into a game where no one speaks your language\n- Some players go on shooting sprees to simply rank up their perks and it ruins the depth of the game\n- Cosmetics. I added this because having very specific cosmetics that you unlock can ruin the fun for this type of game. The idea that everyone looks the same makes it difficult to differentiate between two characters which is fun. People can now just say, \"OH IT'S THE GUY WITHOUT THE SHIRT AND THE GREEN ST. PATTY'S DAY HAT.\" and he becomes a SUPER easy target to find.\n- YOU NEED A MICROPHONE TO PLAY EFFECTIVELY\n- Alot of people play with their friends and only chat in discord or Teamspeak ruining the immersion.\n\n**PROS**\n- Every round feels \"new\" because of the new group of players you are playing with\n- Dev's have been releasing updates pretty often to fix bugs amongst other things\n- Decent price for a decent game\n- Have only had game crash twice out of the 21 hours i've played\n\nWould I recommend this game?

The rounds go by extremely quickly - out of 6 people in your lobby 2 will be infected. It feels like a mini game of one of my favorite movies \"The Thing\". Voice chat is nearly essential with people throwing out accusations about who is infected. \n\nDeceit is in early access, and I have encountered two dropped games in the 6 hours or so I have played. I have gotten stuck in the wall once after being revived.... that being said it runs extremely smoothly. The players contstantly fighting (or teaming up) for the few items per level, plus the lights going out every minute or so really amp up the feeling of panic as you try to work together to escape the asylum.\n\nI think my favorite part of the game at the moment is actually being one of the infected. While the lights are on, I can race around for the same objectives as everyone else, and I know I have one loyal team mate. I can cower in the corner or behind furniture with anyone else as the power fails.... and just before the lights are about to restart - eat some poor bastard that thought he had an ally.

At least they aligned the pistol sights to the centre of the screen and made it accurate when aiming down sights though! Right guys?\n\nMoney grab by devs, soon to implement paid for skins by the looks of things (items still have [PRICE HERE] embedded into them...), and the game is buggy as hell and only gets worse, and has a toxic community.[/i]\n\n[h1]STAY AWAY! Buy on sale perhaps for $4.99.[/h1]\n\nPros:\n\n- Amazing gameplay in a vacuum.\n- When you do eventually get a good game, the gameplay is engaging and fun.\n- Character select screen is the lobby from the original Call of Duty: Black Ops Zombie map ;)\n- Can level up your character and earn perks.\n- Can unlock costumes for your characters\n\nCons:\n\n- Buggy AF.\n- Toxic community\n- Only two maps which get tired real fast\n- Developers keep adding in mostly skins vs 5-10% legitimate bug fixes (of which there are many) which often end up creating new peculiar bugs anyway. Remember this is not an EA game, this isn't good enough.\n- Mouse will be rendered useless one in every 3 games upon joining the game (latest 1GB update did this for me)\n- In order to make the game playable and not run at 20 fps I have to go into settings and select 'Low' which increases frames. But doing this in the main menu DOESN'T STICK. You have to do it for every game you get into!\n- Half games will start with my mouse curser activated in game... One game I was blessed to have the middle click scroll button as my cursor.\n- Game crashes for me once every 8-10 games or so.\n- Often matched with Asians who cannot speak english. Not their fault, but why match Australians, Americans, and other English speaking people with Chinese servers in a game where voice communication is vital?\n- This is more a discontent with human psychology than the game, but people are incredibly stupid in this game and because of this you'll find you only really get a decent game one every 3 or 4 games, not including game crashes, because other innocents will vote you out immediately in the first round because you \"were standing next to empty blood bag therefore infected\". Lumped in with this are people who play in small groups of 3+ and just randomly eliminate people together within the first round. Alot of people do play together/you can tell they are queued with each other but actually play the game properly, props. Anyway, I guess the votekick happy meta will evolve once people learn the game more.\n- The ADS crosshair is 2 cm below the centre of the screen, and accuracy is congruent with this. You're better off aiming from hip with guns.\n\nAll of this aside, if there were global servers and you played with a group of 6 friends (without any collusion), this would be an amazing game.
