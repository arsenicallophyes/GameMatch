I can't decide whether the developers just didn't know how to work with a 3D environment or if they deliberately made things more difficult for keyboard and mouse to simulate controller gameplay. Either way, game mechanics are annoying.\r\n\r\nMy third big issue with this game is camera control. Cut scenes pop up without warning. One moment you can be fighting or scrambling for your life, trying to anticipate the next move, and suddenly you have no control because an unexpected cutscene starts that doesn't even feel like a cutscene at first. There are also many places in the game where you are forced to use specific camera angles while trying to navigate terrain which will hide the path forward from you.\r\n\r\nOverall, this feels more like a game designed for people who like to do speedruns rather than play for story or RPG.", 0.5478567481040955], ["amazing gameplay . absolutely worth buying , the game got so immersive in between . the whole world building is great and the mechanics and puzzles feels amazing . graphics are great too , modern AAA games should learn", 0.5286884903907776], ["played for the 1st time in 2013, replayed a 2nd time 12yrs after release and even tho the graphics are not super, the game itself is still very enjoyable. nice characters and development (from clean look, to banged up and bruised), nice looking maps and explorable areas, enough different types of enemies and behaviors, and most of all, a fantasy like, thrilling story that keeps you motivated to keep going on.  a single run 100% item collection took about 30 hours and honestly, looking at some achievements missed, it shucks that you can not replay a specific chapter in the game, but overall a classic to love.", 0.5253164172172546], ["I love this game, and even though it\u2019s been around for a while, it\u2019s still just as fun and relevant to play today.", 0.523809552192688], ["Tomb Raider (2013) is one of the best games I've ever played.

It's very linear in the story telling and even though it has a large map, it's giving you access to one area at a time along with the story, with the option to go back with fast travel via campsites to explore more or to grab the few collectibles or challenges you might have missed out on during your first visit. All because you wasn't paying attention or because you lacked the equipment to access that certain area when you first encountered it.\n\nThis game does offers really great puzzles that you have to solve to progress, that had me confused more than I wanna admit. A few of the optional tombs can be accounted for here aswell. \n\nGameplay is great, with a few bugs... It's not game breaking, only really annoying. Game is really boring at first but it gets better with more advanced gear and equipment as you progress the story. Game has an easy way to find the stuff you highlight and with more skills earned you can also see collectibles through walls for more easy access. The best way is to look at the map and highlight the collectibles one at a time. The only thing that is impossible to highlight are the challenges required in each area. That's all up to you but I cleared every single one of the challenges without any guides. You just have to pay really good attention and use the survivor instict to find the required things that is asked from you amongst the environment you traverse.\n\nThe game is as I said only alright, it's not the best game I've played but not the worst on the list either. It's a nice origin story for the remake of character that is Lara Croft going from the innocent girl to the ruthless killer that does anything to get what she wants out of any situation. \n\nThe best part of the game is the stealth and without a doubt the gore. When you die, they leave nothing to the imagination. It's rough to look at but so satisfying. \n\nWorst addition to this game is the multiplayer, it's smacked full of bugs and getting the achievements sucks ass. I had to remove my save file to even have the multiplayer achievements trigger for me.
