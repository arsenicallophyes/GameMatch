This game can be terrifying, addictive and fun. Once you start playing you will never want to stop. The atmosphere constantly keeps you on your toes and you never truly know what you're dealing with until the lights start flickering and that's when you know things are about to go down. At the time of writing this there are about 24 real world ghosts with different personalities and traits to give off the illusion that someone actually used to live during that point and time. I also appreciate the attention to detail given to all of the ghost hunting equipment and makes it seem like you're actually apart of one of those ghost hunting TV shows you used to see as a kid back in the day. The threats are constantly unknown, and you will feel the tension in the air, once you fully get used to the horror atmosphere. It becomes addictive, and you will want to spend time earning more equipment as time goes on. My only complaints would be the ghosts constantly looking like Unity Assets when they spawn in during hunts and most of the player death animations are reused for all ghosts. I want to see a little more variety towards death animations and ghost models to an extent so it actually looks like they've arrived from the darkest pits of the unknown. The ghost models do kinda remind me of the Ghosts from Silent Hill 4 except these ones don't float towards you. But rather run towards you like a flickering zombie which I think looks kinda silly. Other than that, I believe this game has potential to be something more and it really shows. This earns a 10/10 rating and the $20 price tag is worth every penny.

If someone is scared of horror games this is the way to start. It brings you in, but the jump scares aren't that bad, and over time you get used to it. 10/10. Get it.

This game nails the atmosphere like no other. The sound design, lighting, and ghost behavior all work together to create an experience that\u2019s genuinely creepy whether you\u2019re solo or in a group. Playing alone is pure nerve-wracking suspense, while co-op turns into a chaotic, hilarious mess of yelling and last-minute rescues (or betrayals). The devs have been constantly updating the game with new content, smarter ghosts, and better tools, and it just keeps getting better.

This cooperative multiplayer game lets you and your friends become paranormal investigators, entering haunted locations armed with various ghost-hunting tools in search of spirits. But be warned\u2014this is not your typical ghost-hunting experience.\n\nAtmosphere: 10/10\nThe atmosphere in Phasmophobia is nothing short of chilling. The dimly lit environments, eerie sound design, and unsettling visuals pull you into a world of paranormal horror. The game\u2019s use of sound to build tension is especially impressive. Every creak, distant whisper, or sudden bang keeps you on edge, making it one of the most immersive horror experiences available.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nThe mechanics of Phasmophobia are surprisingly deep for a horror game. Each ghost behaves differently, and you\u2019ll need to use various tools\u2014such as EMF readers, spirit boxes, and UV lights\u2014to gather evidence and identify the type of spirit haunting the area. The thrill of discovery and the fear of what might happen when you\u2019re left alone with the ghost is a constant tension. The game encourages communication and teamwork, as you and your friends must cooperate to solve the mystery before the ghost becomes hostile.\n\nMultiplayer Fun: 9/10\nThe multiplayer aspect is where Phasmophobia truly shines. Playing with friends is a blast, especially when things go horribly wrong. The sense of camaraderie and shared fear makes the experience uniquely enjoyable. If you\u2019re looking for a game to play with a group, Phasmophobia offers a perfect balance of cooperative strategy and heart-pounding moments of terror. But, the AI behavior for the ghosts can be unpredictable, keeping you on your toes at all times.\n\nTerror Factor: 10/10\nThe horror in Phasmophobia isn\u2019t just about jump scares (although there are plenty). It\u2019s about the constant sense of dread and the terrifying unpredictability of the spirits. The ghosts can interact with you in various ways, some becoming aggressive and hunting you down, while others may remain eerily quiet. The game also does a great job of amplifying your fear by using voice recognition to trigger ghost interactions, so speaking can sometimes lead to disastrous results.\n\nReplayability: 8/10\nWith multiple maps, different ghost types, and varying difficulty levels, Phasmophobia offers plenty of replay value. While the core gameplay loop remains the same, each investigation feels different because of the random nature of the ghosts and the environment. However, the lack of a deeper progression system or major content updates might make some players feel like they've seen everything after a while.\n\nConclusion:\nPhasmophobia is an absolute must-play for fans of horror games, especially those who enjoy multiplayer experiences. The blend of strategic investigation, intense fear, and cooperative gameplay makes it stand out as one of the scariest games on the market. Whether you're teaming up with friends or braving the horrors solo, Phasmophobia offers a truly terrifying and unforgettable experience.\n\nFinal Score: 9/10", 0.523809552192688], ["---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2611 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2611 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks  \n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2611 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second live for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2611 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2610 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2610 Never heard of\n\u2611 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n\u2610 1\n\u2610 2\n\u2610 3\n\u2610 4\n\u2610 5\n\u2610 6\n\u2610 7\n\u2610 8\n\u2611 9\n\u2610 10", 0.52173912525177], ["Very creepy game but it's very fun and less scary with friends!
