Hitman 2 is a great followup to the first of the rebooted series, with a variety of small improvements and some great new levels. In general, the new Hitman games are some of the best stealth experiences out there. The feeling of hiding in plain sight, distracting guards, changing costumes, and pulling off a variety of interesting or tricky kills without being noticed is awesome, the levels are huge with so much detail and so much to explore in repeat attempts. The illuminati-esque story also starts to get pretty interesting.", 0.5253164172172546], ["Got that game on sale with every dlc and it was totally worth it.\nPlayed every mission at least two times and it didn't felt repetetive.", 0.5], ["I have well over 350 hours on this game between the pc version and the xbox version and I have to say it is one of my all time favorite games. Hitman 2 is by far the best looking and best optimized game in the series and has the best missions. This game has infinite replay-ability with jaw dropping detail in each level.
