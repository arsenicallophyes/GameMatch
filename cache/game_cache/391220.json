I'm totally biased towards the game, the \"Tomb Raider\" series has to be my favourite game series of all time. So we will talk about the pros first and of course there are few cons too, just one or two.\n\nPROS: This game's atmosphere is stunning you know things are serious when everything is dark and serious kind of tone. The world building is amazing, when the game starts we are in Syria exploring a tomb which was perfect and then the snowy mountains where it became even better, the swimming into shallow waters and drowning the enemy was perfect. The gun-play became more better and the tomb puzzles became even tougher and the puzzles were very well curated, this time the dev's gave us more freedom with the weapons customization, the weapon upgrade system and the crafting was well detailed. The combat was engaging and the side characters were fascinating, the voice acting was fabulous and the cinematic cut-scenes were amazing because the graphics was better in this game compared to the last one. The story is also very well written and the progression feels smoother and not rushed. The villain in this game had a better story and background and felt stronger compared to the last one who was just a \"cultist\". Overall the game was fantastic and so enjoyable you would love every moment in the game because the world is so gorgeous it's worth exploring. And the dlc \"Baba Yaga\" was a chef's kiss, perfect dlc. \n\nCONS: Last game \"Tomb Raider 2013\" you would have instantly felt an attachment toward Lara and would enjoy the emotions the character brings forward but in this game, I've played more than 40 hrs and still didn't feel the same attachment towards the character as I felt instantly in the previous game.. now that maybe subjective, but while everything around Lara changed and became more better and compelling she on the other hand remained same,, there was no character growth overall. What actually happened was that she lost more of her emotions, like in first game Lara cried, showed frustration which made her character show more depth but in this game it's very shallow, maybe because she became more strong with time, with the losses she overcame but seeing Lara all serious and show so little emotions just didn't feel right. Now this is all subjective and maybe it's all in my head but yeah that was all. \nGreat game 10/10.", 0.7871782183647156], ["---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2611 Beautiful\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2611 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Game Size }---\n\u2610 Floppy Disk\n\u2610 Old Fashioned\n\u2611 Workable\n\u2611 Big\n\u2610 Will eat 10% of your 1TB hard drive\n\u2610 You will want an entire hard drive to hold it\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2611 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2610 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2611 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2610 Worth the price\n\u2611 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2610 Never heard of\n\u2611 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ Replayability }---\n\u2611 One and done\n\u2611 Maybe after a year\n\u2610 Worth a second run\n\u2610 Played it 20 times and still not bored\n\n---{ Microtransactions }---\n\u2610 None\n\u2611 Only cosmetics\n\u2610 Slightly pay-to-progress\n\u2610 Pay-to-win\n\u2610 More shops than gameplay\n\u2610 Casino Simulator\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n\u2610 1\n\u2610 2\n\u2610 3\n\u2610 4\n\u2610 5\n\u2610 6\n\u2611 7\n\u2611 8\n\u2610 9\n\u2610 10", 0.5774679183959961], ["I wish there was something in between thumbs up and thumbs down. This game has some good points to it but it's downfall are the semi-open world areas. They are too big and aren't really full of anything interesting. The cutscenes are long and the trinity leader's voice acting is terrible. \n\nIn addition, there are some late game enemies that should be far more difficult than anything you've faced before based on the lore of the game......Well, they aren't. \n\nThe shop is dumb, too. I have no idea why that was shoehorned into the game, as if some enemy guy would setup a shop to sell things to the random locals who found him... and somehow he only takes payment in ancient coins. Stupid.\n\nAlso the side missions suck.\n\nGame looks great and the mechanics are good, i just can't recommend it cause it's not really fun at times.", 0.5640084743499756], ["Pretty good.

With deeper mechanics, larger hub areas, and a more balanced tone, it\u2019s arguably the best entry in the modern trilogy.\n\nPros:\n\nLara\u2019s growth: Lara is no longer just surviving\u2014she\u2019s becoming the Tomb Raider. Her character is more confident and capable, yet still human. The story explores her obsession with legacy and truth in a believable way.\n\nSemi-open world design: Large hub areas encourage exploration, with optional tombs, puzzles, hidden relics, challenges, and side quests. It feels much more like a \u201creal\u201d archaeological adventure.\n\nBeautiful visuals and atmosphere: From snowy Siberian peaks to underground ruins, the environments are diverse and stunning. Weather effects and lighting create a strong sense of place.\n\nImproved tombs and puzzles: Optional challenge tombs are more frequent and better designed than in the 2013 game. They feel clever and rewarding.\n\nSolid gameplay variety: Stealth, combat, traversal, crafting, and survival blend together smoothly. There\u2019s a lot of freedom in how you approach situations.\n\nUpgrades and gear progression: Skill trees, weapons, outfits, and resource crafting offer more depth and customization than before.\n\nCons:\n\nStory still plays it safe: While better than in the first game, the main plot follows familiar beats (ancient artifact, secret cult, family drama). It\u2019s serviceable, but not groundbreaking.\n\nCombat pacing: Combat is generally well-executed, but some encounters feel a bit too game-y or repetitive in later sections.\n\nSide content can feel checklist-y: Some of the collectibles and challenges start to blur together if you're going for 100%.\n\nConclusion:\n\nRise of the Tomb Raider strikes an excellent balance between cinematic storytelling and gameplay freedom. It refines nearly every aspect of the reboot and adds more meaningful exploration, making it feel like a true evolution of the franchise. For fans of adventure, mystery, and exploration, it\u2019s a must-play.", 0.5], ["Always have been fan of the franchise, great game - always seen as \"like uncharted\" but I like to think that it is almost at the same level as the uncharted series and has its own personality as a franchise", 0.5], ["Don't know why took me this long to play the game.
