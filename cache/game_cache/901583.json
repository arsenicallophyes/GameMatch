I made it to the final mission and one of the last actions you take is tied to your FPS. It's genuinely impossible above about 30 FPS and there is no way to cap FPS in the game.

I understand its on a player to player basis and does not adhere to everyone who buys and plays the game but rockstar likes to make things extremely complicated when it should be as simple as you bought the game so go play it. Instead they want you to go through extra hoops and hurdles. I dont have access to my old social club acc from YEARS ago yet they insist I link the steam acc regardless. FYI my email account was disabled due to inactivity of me not being able to sign in. So, why am i typing all of this? I asked rockstar for help and im waiting for a response. Gaming used to be simple, it meant something.

While I'll always have a soft spot for GTA 5 I can understand why so many fans love this game more despite it's flaws, it's such a charming yet dark game in the series.\n\nSadly the port for PC is dogshit, as much as Rockstar are incredible game developers they absolutely suck when it comes to porting/fixing their games for some weird reason. Luckily the best way to fix it is by using GranAlan-84's 'Grand Theft Auto IV: CE - The Improved Classic' mod that helps fix the bugs and glitches within the game and restore missing content like the songs that were cut due to expired music licenses. Other than this issue this is a game worth playing even if it's only once just to experience the story, it's worth every minute of your time :D\n\nEdit: Also I think it's worth mentioning a fix I found for the \"Taxi bug\" and/or the bug where every car that spawns is similar to the one your driving, I've seen people on here asking around on how to fix it so I thought I'd include it in my review. After you install the Improved Classic mod by GranAlan-84 (which includes the fusion fix that you'll need for this bug fix) if you go and open the INI of fusion fix, then find the line:\n\n[BudgetedIV]\nVehicleBudget =\n\nAnd enter a number value in there, I went and used 120000000 which most people seem fine with (although if you can you could also change it to 144000000 but I haven't tested it myself so I just recommend inputting 120000000 just incase) and then boom it should be fixed. I haven't experienced any issues thankfully but I have heard that your game could start to crash when you're on the bridge with a lot of cars (although this could probably be countered by reducing the amount of cars spawning in the in-game settings) or when you try to enter the mission \"snow storm\" from Elizabetha so I recommend proceeding with caution, if you can't progress the game any further at some point around this time then maybe trying putting the number value back to 0 and see if it fixes.

GTA 4 still holds up and does many things better than GTA 5. I haven't played Gay Tony yet but lost & the damned is fantastic. It's basically sons of anarchy in GTA.

A dark, heavy case for my old PlayStation 3.\nBut it wasn\u2019t just a game.\nIt was the beginning of something.\nIt was GTA IV.\n\nI installed it, turned on the console, and it was as if the real world faded away.\nI spent every hour of that day lost in Liberty City.\nThe gray skies, the towering bridges, the radio songs that stitched themselves into my memory forever.\nI wasn\u2019t playing it. I was living it.\n\nAnd then came so many new saves. So many different choices. Endless drives with no destination, just the city breathing around me.\nI knew every street, every shortcut, every secret alley.\nAnd without any guide\u2014when the internet was still a slow, rare luxury\u2014I saw every ending, discovered every hidden thing.\nIt was my world.\nIt was home.\n\nEvery now and then, my father would sit beside me.\nHe\u2019d watch the screen in silence.\nHe came from an era of Contra, so to him, this was like seeing a movie you could control.\nI still remember that one time I handed him the controller and let him try to drive a car.\nHe crashed almost instantly.

I won't go on about the driving, bit it did screw me over more than once even after I felt I was quite good at it.\n\nAlso the missions are pretty much all the same, go here kill this... and there's no mid mission check points!
