From the moment you step into the game, you're immersed in a beautifully crafted world filled with mystery, danger, and adventure.

Its open world design and survival mechanics, combined with the zombie combat elements, make for an incredibly engaging and entertaining experience. Exploring the vast world, uncovering hidden caves, and collecting all the achievements added a great sense of accomplishment and discovery.\n\nOne of the standout aspects is the freedom it offers in terms of gameplay. Building bases, scavenging for supplies, and surviving alongside friends adds a layer of depth that keeps things fresh and exciting.\n\nHowever, the story leaves much to be desired. While I won\u2019t go into spoilers, the narrative feels underwhelming, especially with its multiple endings. It lacks the impact and cohesion I was hoping for.\n\nThat said, this game is far from being a bad title. While it may not be the best game I\u2019ve ever played, it\u2019s definitely one I\u2019d recommend particularly for fans of open world survival games with cooperative multiplayer. If you enjoy zombie themed gameplay, exploration, and base building, this one is well worth your time.\n\n", 0.6021220088005066], ["The Forest drops you into a beautiful yet terrifying wilderness where the locals aren't exactly welcoming (think cannibalistic mutants with a serious personal space issue).

The reason for this is probably because this game has a story. When you start the game there is no sense of direction or what to do. I was very confused for this reason and ended up at the \"end game\" location without knowing it. I also thought trees didn't regrow, but I was wrong about that.\n\nI tried giving the game another chance 2 years later and this time I focused on taking it easy, explore every corner, read the clues and the notes to figure out what to do and what I need, and it ended up being a very interesting game. I really enjoyed the \"mysteriousness\" of the game that I initially hated, exploring the caves one by one finding new gear and clues to complete the story. Building a base, and the constant fear of getting raided by cannibals. The enemies progressively become stronger the longer you play the game. At the end of the day, it's still a pretty linear game since you need to explore the caves in a specific order, but that's something you need to figure out yourself so there's still some freedom in the game. As for the story, it didn't interest me that much, I only really enjoyed exploration, building, crafting, and surviving, planning my next steps.
