But I'm coming back to this game after a bit of a hiatus. In the meantime, I've played Workers and Resources, OpenTTD, Transport Fever 2, and Rail Route in this niche of gaming. The thing that just baffles me right out the gate, starting a new map, is just how bad the road laying tools are. Not that W&R gets credit for being easy, it's not. But it's amazing to me that this game had the success it did, with the positive reviews it had (until now) with these major flaws. \r\n\r\nFirst off, you're starting a map with a divided highway going through it. Yet, you don't actually have those types of roads unlocked, namely high speed on and off ramps. So you can't even manipulate the goofy interchange they put on the map for you. OK fine, I'll use the one way single lane roads with a low speed limit. And as much as I hate them IRL and in game, let's see if I can build a cloverleaf so I can just get stuff started. The way roads connect and interact is so bad, I just can't even continue. Even with anarchy, which really just makes your roads look glitched and stupid. You can't create a proper angled ramp. It's basically a little intersection that curves steeply off the road you're connecting to. The way this game cannot properly handle road connected at angles makes it a fundamental no from me. I've seen plenty of content creators trying to solve this problem to try to create semi realistic intersections and interchanges. The fact that you have to sit there and fiddle with something that should be EASY in a game like this is just sad. If I want to sit and fiddle with complicated things, I'll play Oxygen not Included or W&R. CS is supposed to be approachable.
