If you have a very powerful PC, it's easily one of the best survival games you can currently play in VR. The problem is, it's terribly optimized, so you really need high-end hardware \u2013 ideally one of the newest 3D CPUs and at least an RTX 4090.\n\nPersonally, I wasn\u2019t able to play it properly until I upgraded to a 5700X3D this year. Most VR games are very demanding, especially on the CPU. Of course, a strong GPU is also necessary, but without a powerful processor, your GPU won\u2019t be used to its full potential.\n\nAnd honestly, this kind of survival game makes no sense outside of VR. I\u2019ve also played the regular (non-VR) version of Green Hell, and it just doesn\u2019t compare. It lacks the same atmosphere and immersion, and it never will come close to the VR experience.\n\nSo, if you're thinking about buying this game, make sure you have a high-end CPU and GPU first \u2013 otherwise, you\u2019ll end up being just another frustrated player leaving a negative review.", 0.5472527146339417], ["ABANDONWARE!!!!!!
