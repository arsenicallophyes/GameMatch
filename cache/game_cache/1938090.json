The game franchise that somehow manages to release the same game every single year, slap a different name on it, and still charge full price like it\u2019s the second coming of gaming innovation.\r\n\r\nGameplay? Copy + Paste.\r\nEvery year it's:\r\n\r\nSprint \u2192 Slide \u2192 Jump \u2192 Die to some 12-year-old halfway across the world bunny-hopping with an MP5.\r\n\r\nRespawn \u2192 Get killed by a camper in the corner \u2192 Rage.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s the real Call of Duty cycle. Forget skill \u2014 this game rewards whoever can mount their gun on a window ledge faster than you can say \"broken hitboxes.\"\r\n\r\nMaps? Recycled Garbage.\r\nRemember that one map you liked from 10 years ago? Surprise, it's back! Only now it\u2019s somehow worse. Either it's littered with a million objects that block movement or wide open fields where snipers thrive like mosquitoes in summer.\r\n\r\nSkill-Based Matchmaking (SBMM) \u2014 aka SweatFest 3000\r\nTrying to have fun? Not in this economy. The game sees you do well for ONE match and suddenly throws you into lobbies with professional esports wannabes rocking headsets more expensive than your console.\r\n\r\nMicrotransactions \u2014 The Real MVP\r\nWant a cool skin? $20. Want that same skin but in a slightly different color? Another $20. Want to actually feel like content isn\u2019t locked behind a paywall? Too bad.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s like they sat in a meeting and said, \"How can we charge players for basic fun?\"\r\n\r\nWarzone? More like Bugzone.\r\nCheaters, invisible skins, broken guns, game crashes \u2014 it\u2019s like a free-to-play FPS mixed with a beta test nobody asked for. Every patch fixes 1 bug and adds 3 new ones.\r\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\r\nCall of Duty isn\u2019t a game anymore \u2014 it\u2019s a $70 annual subscription to rage, sweat, and disappointment. But somehow... we all keep playing it. And that\u2019s probably the biggest scam of all.\r\n\r\n", 0.8045846819877625], ["Honestly at this point I just play Call of Duty for zombies and to turn my brain off is small map hardcore mode. I would NOT be caught dead in Warzone.\n\nUpdate: I was caught dead in Warzone, thanks for the Casual mode.", 0.7151354551315308], ["    They banned you for nothing and when you ask what is the reason, they just made up something like you violated the terms of use. When you demand the proof of your so-called violation they simply say '' oh, sorry because of our security policy we can't tell you what exactly you have done wrong and please don't do the same thing again with your new account or you will be banned again.''  \n\n    So basically, if you are interesting in spending 60 dollars for a game and even more, if you are in to micropayments and spending hundreds of hours on it, you need to know they could take that away from you only because they want it without showing an actual proof. Moreover, you can't reach the customer service or a real person to sort this out in any possible way and find yourself in steam review section while writing this down.\n\n   To be honest, I am not pissing of because I am banned. If I deserve it, so be it. But you have to tell me what did I do.\nBesides, saying please don't do the same thing in future with new account or you will be banned again is simply a mockery. I got 486 hours on this game and I played same in each minute of it, then why you didn't ban me untill this time. Anyway, you guys get the moral of the story. This could be happened to anyone of you.\n\nBuy it at your own risk.\n\n\n        \n      Now, apart from the injustice of activision. Let's dive in the game review for multiplayer.\n\n1. Teammates can drag you to the direction they are running much faster than you could run and you have no control over yourself for a few seconds. But somehow you can't do the same to your teammates. This happens in hardcore all the time and they couldn't fix it for 15 years.\n \n2. Most of the maps are garbage. How 6 people can't eleminate other 6 people 75 times in ten minutes. That is how awfull the maps called redcard and rewind. Game should start with 20 people on such maps by default. So people don't have to select only nuketown 7/24 and steakout 7/24 for have some fun.\n\n3. Speaking of nuketown, in all version of this map, this version has the worst spawning mechanizm ever.\n\n4. Useless scorestreaks like interceptors and strategic bomber should be remove from the game.\n\n5. The matchmaking matches you different players allmost each time. So, you can't play with same people few games in a row and make some friends. People used to make friends with each other thanks to former matchmaking system. Players tend to spend more time in a game while their friends are around and I guess they just don't care about it.\n\n6. I bought an operator too. But come on, A turtle with an AK-47 ?\n\n7. I play only hardcore for much realistic gameplay. But all of the game modes are not available on hardcore and of course there is no ranked play for hardcore players.\n\nSo, these were the negative things I would like Activision to change to make this game much better. Nevertheless, none of them is matter anymore, since I am banned haphazardly. Eventhough, I liked to play cod ( look my hours ) I don't think I will buy a new bo6 or any other futher cod game. (Funny thing though, I have bought MW Remasterd and Infinity Warfare from Xbox discount just before a day I have been banned :D)\n\nThank you for reading this review and have a nice day. :)\n", 0.6447919011116028], ["I've never played or had a game that crashed so much as this game.
