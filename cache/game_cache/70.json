Say what you want about the Doom Marine or the Quake Ranger, but they are both rather inert individuals stuck in a perpetual state of bedlam that serves to satiate the most primitive part of the brain. Enter Gordon Freeman, a selective mute and slightly deranged scientist embarking on an extraplanar adventure to save the world from an alien threat as well as a government conspiracy, all while clobbering head crabs with a crowbar. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3449171651 \nThe excellent first person gameplay is set in a clandestine laboratory in a vaguely \u201cThe Mist\u201d inspired military research facility, complete with a built-in tram for expedient transportation. On your way to unravel the mystery of the alien invaders you collect a rather extravagant arsenal of weapons that ranges from shotguns and guided rockets to alien bio-guns that shoot extraterrestrial wasps or little friendly snarks to perfect the mutilation of the opposition. The campaign is fantastic and holds up to this day, even if the later parts have some questionable areas that remain a challenge to those among us with perpetually bad timing.. \n\nI am aware that nothing I write will ever triumph over the legacy that this game carries on its broad and muscular shoulders, so I will just finish with a short conclusion. \n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] Half-Life might have aged a bit graphically but it is still a fantastic game that has withstood the test of time, and you can\u2019t help but admire the audacity of game whose main premise is that a nerd in a hazmat suit is outgunning heavily armed marines and alien shocktroopers..", 0.651439905166626], ["Has to be the best game that has ever existed.

Its old graphics give me nostalgia, and its gameplay is horrifyingly brilliant. I wish there were more games like this, but it is uncloneable.", 0.5394737124443054], ["Half Life came out in 1998 and yes, I played it as a child, even though I shouldn't. The German version even had these quirks that you had to fight robots instead of soldiers, so that the game could get a 16+ rating. So me and my friends downloaded uncut patches from the internet just to get blood back into the game. Man, we were sick back then.\n\nIn Half Life, you play as Gorden Freeman, an MIT graduate with apparent weapons training (what you need as a scientist), because the game is an FPS which lets you fight against an entire army and a horde of aliens. The story is sometimes so confusing and mysterious that I sometimes don't even understand what it's about. But basically in this game it's about a failed experiment with portals and a subsequent invasion by an alien race from a border world called Xen, and your goal is to escape the research facility in one piece while everything around you collapses.\n\nI like the science-themed setting and the Lovecraftian style of the aliens. As also noted in Half-Life 2, this game has an environmental story telling, meaning no long explanations or overlays, but the game goes for presentation and visual guidance and it does that really well. There are also smaller gimmicks as you can interact with all sorts of objects in Half-Life. Things like a filing cabinet can be destroyed and notepads and other office accessories fly out. This may not sound like much, but back then it was something special and not every game today offers this kind of immersion. After all, the game came out at a time when 3D models consisted of five-sided polygons, so there wasn't a lot of graphics to show off as there is today.\n\nThe first chapter is about learning the mechanics of the game and allows you to use what you've learned over and over again. I had the feeling that it was less forgiving than Half-Life 2 and you have to learn things by trial and error, but that's part of the game. With autosaves or quicksaves, it shouldn't be a problem to save before problematic sections and again if you. Sometimes the controls can be a bit choppy, but maybe that's because I'm used to modern controls. The movement speed in Half-Life is pretty damn fast and probably wasn't as unusual back then as it seemed to me at first. The game features a lot of platform action (which I'm not a fan of now) and you do tend to miss and then jump to your death several times.\n\nSpeaking of platformer action: There are some parts of the game that are more fun than others, in my opinion, but I had the feeling that it alternates well. It's probably intentional, because I remember Gabe saying in an interview that they took this into consideration. However, the last part on Xen is unfortunately a bit disappointing because they've pushed this platformer issue to the limit. I can understand that they might try to make a different world authentic in this way with Moonjump-like jumps and design the puzzles accordingly. But unfortunately they didn't come close to the puzzles you had to solve in Black Mesa.\n\nWhat can I say? After all, it's one of the best games i played (and i don't usually play a lot of FPS). If you haven't played the game yet, you should catch up.", 0.523809552192688], ["I'm really late to this game so it feels like I shouldn't really have much to say; this game is older than me. That being said, if you're also like me, and you have had zero exposure or knowledge about this game, I 1000% recommend giving it a playthrough. The graphics aren't beautiful in the stereotypical way they can be nowadays but there's something really satisfying about both the graphics and how smooth the game can run on even the worst of computers. I played this on my laptop and it ran better than 95% of ROBLOX games. The sound design is genuinely charming and not once did I feel bored, even though my first and only playthrough was 20 hours long just by exploring every single nook and cranny (it shouldn't take you that long lol). The only major glitch I had was [spoiler]when fighting Gonarch, she got stuck just before the last section of the fight and no amount of reloading saves fixed it, so I had to manually break through the floor[/spoiler].    More than anything though, the story really just shines through and sets up an impressively immersive experience given what the game is. \nOverall, it's definitely a game I think almost every person should play at least once, and I can't wait to play the second one.\nTW: blood, slight gore (1990's pixelated gore)\n\n---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Grandma\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2611 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2611 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 Lovely\n\u2610 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2611 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2610 Never heard of\n\u2611 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n\u2610 1\n\u2610 2\n\u2610 3\n\u2610 4\n\u2610 5\n\u2610 6\n\u2610 7\n\u2610 8\n\u2611 9\n\u2610 10", 0.523809552192688], ["the best game ever.\n\nhalf life has smooooooth controls, amazing storytelling (and world building), funni voice acting, a great range of weapons, pretty level and character design, just pay the 10$ already.", 0.523809552192688], ["The disappointment I feel for this game is simply immeasurable. It is such an iconic addition to the FPS genre, and has been an inspiration to so many other games - and tons of other media - that it feels wrong to give it a negative review. If I were to say that I enjoyed it, however, that would be a lie. For the good in this, it is evident that a standard was set with this title. The puzzles, the gameplay, the silent protagonist, the guns. For the time that it was made, too, you can tell that so much must have went in to making it what it was. Even some of the other more unique bits of the game, like the movement and the sneaking portions, must have been super novel for when it was released. Normally, I try to be impartial to older titles given advancements in technology and game design making it unfair to compare them to the modern stuff, but I can't overlook the fact that its age shows. It is a buggy mess, and while I am not one to care for graphics so much as gameplay and story, the look of it is unenjoyable and does not have a nostalgic charm to it for me. It was fun to bhop around like it was CS:S, and some of the more common clipping bugs were also tolerable, but its evident that when exploiting those things, that the game is simply not meant to be run that way. For me, the protagonist also felt really hard to maneuverer with the way that counterstrafing made the screen shake a little, how fast the speed was, and when trying to use buttons not having them work for whatever reason. I could have overlooked all of these issues as quirks from an old Source engine title, however, if only the game had kept me interested. While there was a story, every level felt the same to me. Kill some enemies, push some buttons, go around the base. At some point, around the 3/4 mark, I just gave up and got bored with the constant monotony of it all. I do not want to waste another minute of my time slowly picking off enemies as they progressively get harder and larger in quantity. There are a lot of other titles, more modern ones, that do just that and better given their production was conducted in a time when bugs and other quirks could be worked out in development. Like I said, Half-Life certainly set a standard. My regret is not playing it before I had played other games that followed its lead, given they simply can do it better by building off the established norms that this title either created or perfected during its prime. I understand a lot of people probably love it for its nostalgia, or enjoy it for its easily runnable structure, but I simply cannot get into it, no matter how hard I tried to love it.
