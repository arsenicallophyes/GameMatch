I had never played the early access. I patiently waited. I set up a dedicated server, so the factory can run even when I am not in game and here's the verdict:\n\nThis game is on of the very few that can be considered somewhat of a cure to the sickness that we see in the gaming industry today. It's polished. It works! You can create MASSIVE interconnected systems. Explore, there's a TON to discover. The gameplay feels rewarding. It let's you play how you want, change the rules if you will and make it Harder/Easier, play with friends (4-player co-op is not a hard limit, it can be changed in an .ini file), it doesn't shove propaganda and ideology down your throat, it lets you have fun. It has a great sense of humor! And best of all, it has OFFLINE LAN play. Just like Baldur's Gate 3, Factorio, Mindustry and Minecraft (that I played also on my dedicated server with my kids) :D Of course there are other titles out there that sport all of the above, but I just want to say a massive THANK YOU to Coffee Stain Studios for staying humble and staying true and not taking the route of other companies that take the shareholder pleasing route and then blame their clients when things go wrong!\n\nI will buy this game for my kids and friends in the months to come. Love you for this! Excellent job!", 0.8242403864860535], ["431 hrs in Epic and then bought this again to play through also the Steam achievements. So yes, one of my favourite games ever to spend my time on. A good balance of planning, building and some exploration, nasty spiders and inventory management.", 0.6236934065818787], ["This is a game that will make time slip away\u2014if you have any to spare, of course. Similar to Factorio, Satisfactory is a logistics game in which the player explores to acquire materials to build materials needed to construct an orbiting station facility. In short, great game with a lot of value. People who like to play Call of Duty or don't like to think too much while playing games make take issue with Satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe game is quite astounding visually and delivers a solid [b]gameplay[/b] experience while testing the player's ability to organize and design a factory. It's a little crazy going from the 2D-ish world of Factorio to an open 3D world of Satisfactory. The map itself is quite vast (not painfully vast) and unlike Factorio, doesn't rely on seeds. The map is hand crafted and remains the same no matter what playthrough the player is on. Could be good or bad depending on who is playing. The [b]controls[/b] are pretty solid and include a lot of manoeuvres that even I didn't expect. The big one is the ability to press the crouch button and, given enough speed, ability to slide. Extremely useful early game when trying to get down hills or down conveyer belts. Moreover, every action is easy to access and easy to implement given how everything is laid out. The player feels in complete control while fighting, building, exploring, or simply sitting around and thinking.\r\n\r\nThe game world itself offers quite a bit to the player to check out. There are resources that the player can discover, pickup, and research to further unlock other equipment or abilities. Most mines are accessible, but will require some special equipment to access. There are three main stations (there are more, but for the sake of length): crafting bench, equipment bench, and a MAM (research station). Crafting bench allows the player to make new materials by hand (handy early game before automation), the equipment bench which allows players to make hand held tools and suit modifications, and the MAM allows the player to research new materials or equipment. There is a lot of additional buildings that are unlocked and available as the player progresses through \"Tiers\". Tiers can be completed by researching with mined or refined materials. When the tiers that are available (tiers appear two at a time) are completed, the player is requested to continue building the Space Elevator. When materials are delivered to the Space Elevator, then new tiers unlock.\r\n\r\nThe [b]visuals and graphics[/b] are actually pretty good. Although I was expecting Unity type graphics and assets, the designers did a good job creating the objects, creatures, and the world itself. The world doesn't change, but a pretty good job was done designing its topography (map) and some of the sights are definitely wonderful to see. When I discovered oil by the sand patches, there was a few times I stopped just to enjoy the view of the horizon (albeit virtual). All the requires animations seem to be there and the game is relatively smooth overall in this domain. The [b]sounds and music[/b] was another domain that was well done. The music doesn't feel like generic factory music, and seems to have hints of geographic culture depending on the song playing (some hints of Asian music mixed in with the music they've produced). Most of the sounds are appropriate and give the player a hint of what is going on in their surroundings. There are some sounds (like the crafting sound especially early in the game) that may annoy players, holding the button down for a minute or two to get a good stack of material.\r\n\r\nOverall, I would recommend this game on sale. I don't think the full price is worth it, but anyone that plays it can tell that there was a lot of thought put forth into the game connecting the objects, world, environment, and style of play all together. The game is a lot better with friends (and faster) and I feel it has a decent amount of replayability, given you're not tired from trying to connect pieces across the map. The multiplayer aspect is a nice addition and better controller support would perhaps attract more of a player base. Small additions to the game, such as enemies that can attack the player and hidden hard drives that provide upgrades, add an extra layer of excitement to keep players engaged. Good game, but would recommend doing your homework if you're completely new to the automation/building genre.\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1]RATING: 8.4/10[/h1]\r\n\r\n\r\n[table]\r\n[tr]\r\n\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002[td]Gameplay[/td]\r\n\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002[td]B[/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002[td]Story / Campaign[/td]\r\n\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002[td]B[/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002[td]Visuals / User Interface[/td]\r\n\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002[td]B[/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002[td]Sounds / Music[/td]\r\n\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002[td]B[/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002[td]Replay-ability[/td]\r\n\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002[td]B-[/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[tr]\r\n\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002[td]Overall [/td]\r\n\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002[td]B[/td]\r\n[/tr]\r\n[/table]", 0.6067069172859192], ["if you have OCD max efficiency tism then you'll like it\r\n\r\nget a tv show running in 2nd monitor for optimal enjoyment. fun with friends.\r\n\r\nps. get a friend to help figure things out early or watch a yt guide.
