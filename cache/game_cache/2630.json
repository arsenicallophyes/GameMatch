Like it predecessor \"Call of Duty\" and its successor \"Call of Duty: World at War\" - its one of the only games that are well made for WWII (in my opinion these 3 games are the only good ones connected with WWII). The graphics, yes, they are old, but they look good, I believe. They still hold up and look well for 20 years later. Unlike its predecessor, the graphics don't feel as old. A big improvement there. Gameplay is fun as frick! It's amazing, again, yes, nothing special, but tons of fun and a lot to do, you even have Multiplayer introduced here. It's a WWII FPS, nothing to fancy, but you don't need fancy here, it's just so good. Storyline is great. I love it! Thanks to these games (when I was about 8-9 years old), I learned a lot about history and put myself in these scenarios. I can only imagine what people went through, I tear up at some missions, remembering that this all actually happened. I would highly recommend playing this game! \r\nOverall I would give this game as well, a 10/10! For sure.
