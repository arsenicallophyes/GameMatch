Sadly, my experience with it has reached a point where I can no longer recommend the game. Here's why:[/h2]\n\nRecently, I played a match as killer. I was up against a premade with both console and PC players. I\u2019ll admit, I let my ego take over and played a sweaty match. In the end, I got a clean 4K, and not a single gen was completed. But I didn\u2019t tunnel or camp. I played fair, took chases as they came, and didn\u2019t give them much room to breathe.\n\nAfter the game, I found out one of the survivors was a small Twitch streamer. So I thought I\u2019d check her out, curious to see the match from her POV.\n\nWhat I found was disheartening...\n\nThe two PC players were in her live chat insulting her, saying she was terrible and shouldn't be streaming at all. But in truth, she and her friend (the other console player) actually performed better than the ones throwing insults. she gave me more of a chase, lasted longer, and were clearly putting effort into the match. But they treated her horribly.\n\nI felt bad after that, so I followed her channel and joined the live chat. I let her know that I was the killer in that game and said sorry if I played a bit too hard. To my surprise, she was really friendly and thanked me for the match. She said she had fun, and you could tell she meant it. She had such a kind and cheerful vibe, and even though she lost, she stayed positive.\n\nWhat really got to me was how she dealt with everything. Even while they were insulting her, she stayed calm, kind, and kept a positive attitude. She didn\u2019t get angry or fight back. You could tell she was just trying to have fun and enjoy the game with her friend. She didn\u2019t deserve to be treated like that at all.\n\nIt was honestly upsetting to see. She seemed like a young scouse girl, maybe 16 or 17 years old, just streaming for a bit of fun. She only had 39 followers and two people watching, and yet even in that small space, she was getting hate for no good reason. It felt really unfair, and it stuck with me.\n\nI take full responsibility for playing a tough match. But I didn\u2019t tunnel. I didn\u2019t camp. I played as fairly as I could. What wasn\u2019t fair was the way she was treated by those PC players.\n\nI\u2019ve been playing Dead by Daylight since it first came out. My Steam profile only shows 69 hours, but I\u2019ve spent a lot more time on console. Over the years, I\u2019ve seen both the good and bad sides of the community. There have been some really nice, positive moments. But there have also been times like this, where someone kind ends up getting hurt for no real reason.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to play, it\u2019s best to team up with friends. But if you\u2019re playing alone, just be careful out there.", 0.8198419213294983], ["Genuinely impressive this game has survived for a decade on just generators, pallets and windows while developing the most toxic and sad community in gaming.", 0.8150039315223694], ["So... in the last two years, I have spent nearly 900 hours in Dead by Daylight. That's 37 days of my life. Several full Netflix series binges. A small vacation. Time I could have spent learning another language, mastering an instrument or re-learning the violin, or even developing meaningful human relationships. Instead, I chose to run in circles around pallets while being tunneled by 14-year-olds.\n\nWhy? Because I stream, and apparently, some people in my chat would like to see me suffer. This game is like a toxic ex. You know it's bad for you. Your friends tell you it's bad for you. But then the matchmaking ends, and suddenly you're back in the fog, crouching inside a bush while a Huntress moonwalks past me, like the ghost of Michael Jackson possessing a lag switch.\n\nFantastic idea to add Ken, by the way. Being bitten through walls is brilliant! He really likes the crunch of it all. The amount of times I run into bugs has definitely decreased over these past two years, too. I'm never randomly unable to use one of my perks or stuck in one animation for no reason whatsoever (that's sarcasm). Once, a hacker floated away with me like on a hot air balloon. I guess that counts as exciting and new.\n\nI also love getting toxic messages in the endgame chat, especially in a language I, and many others, don't speak. Get everyone as a killer? Tryhard. Get looped? GG ez. Teammate doesn't unhook you? That's just your average Feng. Just a few days ago, my teammate left me at the altar and got replaced by a bot, who then promptly decided to teabag in front of me and run off without healing me. I think they've done a pretty good job so far in recreating the average DBD player.\n\nAnd yet, here I am, playing this game with my trusty +1 that got me into this mess in the first place. At least he makes up for his sins by dying on hook for me. And sometimes, just sometimes, we even get a cool match, where Wesker stays with me in bed in Ormond, or we gather by the fireplace and do a little dance to appease the entity. Or survivors don't try to flashbang me every five seconds.\n\nWould I recommend this game?\nNo.\nWill I play another 100 hours?\nYes.\nDo I need help?\nPlease.\n\nThanks for coming this far. You'll see me in the queue in 7 minutes.", 0.6548749208450317], ["I enjoy playing this game and I'm satisfied with the huge variety of skins of survivors and killers The graphics are awesome and provide smooth gameplay throughout the game and I could easily say that it is successful in reflecting the atmosphere. But there isn't anything new in terms of gameplay. Instead, errors are getting frequent; the new killer Kaneki, is way too powerful to hunt survivors. Even the worst Kaneki player could kill a survivor easily. There should be some kind of disadvantage. He is able to go faster using his kagune and that's ok, but its' frequency/waiting time should be longer since survivors already can't run as fast as killers (yeah, without kagune) and he could bite survivors easily and that's also ok, but he shouldn't be able to bite from that far...Besides this certain killer, recently added latest survivors are also a bit problematic: Their perks are way too useless to make them worth buying. If you want players to buy some kind of new survivor, at least make their perks worth buying. Not just their physical and skin look. (I have nothing to say about their physical look and their skin, they look sickly awesome) Other than that, please don't misunderstand. I really enjoy playing this game with my friends but the base game itself is still open for development and there are lots of stuff to fix.", 0.6399337649345398], ["this game is like a toxic relationship i keep coming back and getting hurt but i cant get enough of it", 0.6350365281105042], ["An absolutely godawful, unbalanced mess that gets worse with each update and added killers. The game blatantly favors the killer by buffing all of their perks while nerfing all of the survivors perks. Though the worst part by is that there is absolutely no punishment for exclusively going after one survivor while deliberately ignoring the others (Tunneling). The player base on both the survivor and killer side are completely toxic and generally unpleasant.\n\nEven if these issues are at some point fixed i still wouldn't recommend this game as the developers would probably find a different way to ruin it.", 0.6297599673271179], ["This game has wrecked my soul.

Kaneki is the latest example of this trend. They give him an overloaded kit that makes near impossible to outrun: 2 leaps that cover insane distance, a point-click hit-scan move that can hit through WALLS and OBJECTS and empowers you to get EVEN MORE mobility. I thought Blight was bad, but this new killer is even worse. At least with killers with high mobility like wesker, you can attempt to outplay by dodging his dash, but since BEhavior decided to give Ghoul an overloaded kit that deludes his playerbase into thinking they're good at the game.

I don't usually write books in my reviews but bare with me for a moment.\r\n\r\nI've played so many games with some of most toxic most hated most degenerate people in the so called \"Gaming Universe\". We know that 100% of competitive games will have built-in mechanics to make people feel emotional at times. In this case it's me playing the nurse. \r\n\r\nI also want to mention that the newly released \"Ghoul\" is not on nurse's lvl. However I do think he is more beginner friendly and stronger than the rest of the killers. Moving on.\r\n\r\nAs a p20 myers main that has quickly learned to how play the strongest killer in the game, it is verbally impossible to get away from having insults thrown at you after every post-game lobby as the nurse. Truth be told not everyone can pilot her correctly, having said that, she is still the strongest and always will be. \r\n\r\nI started playing her 24/7 since the start of the newly released \"Blood Moon\" event. Which btw is still better than the regular dbd gamemode, how do you people keep playing that all the time? w.e\r\n\r\nThe purpose of me busting out the nurse every game is to make sure I speedrun my way to prestige 1 on all of my characters. By \"speedrunning\" I DO NOT mean tunneling. Like it or not I am always playing for 4 kills. Having said that if you blind me 3 times in a row, then I have an excuse. ALSO why are we making up words to sh*t on killers? \"restarted slugger\" \"cringe slugging tw*t\". Is a killer supposed to ignore the two flashlight holding survivors (with sprint burst) that are waiting for you to pick up the downed survivor, instead of going for them directly? Like what are we even doing? Yeah let me just pretend you're not there, lol.\r\n\r\nEnough yapping from my side. Why am I even typing this in the first place? To tell you that these people not only privately insult me on my only social media platform, they also find out who my family members are and harass them too.
