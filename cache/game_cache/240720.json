This sh*t made me break my monitor three f*cking times. THREE. I\u2019m typing this on a replacement keyboard because the last one was murdered by a flying coffee mug during my fourth fall back to the f*cking beginning. Not to mention, my PC\u2019s fans were screaming like they were being exorcised, overheating so bad it could've cooked a godd*mn steak on the GPU.\n\nThis game made me so loud, my parents thought I was possessed. They packed my bags and drove me to an adoption center like I was some kind of demonic foster project gone wrong. Do you know what it feels like to be disowned because a man in a pot couldn\u2019t climb a mountain with a f*cking hammer? I do.\n\nAnd Bennett Foddy? That calm-ass narrator with his smug, philosophical bullsh*t quotes while I\u2019m spiraling into a black hole of pure f*cking rage? F*ck that guy. No one needs a voiceover quoting Nietzsche when they just lost 45 minutes of progress because their mouse had a slight hiccup.\n\nYou think you\u2019re making progress, right? You hit the tree, passed the garbage can, launched yourself over the house, and you're like, \"Maybe I can do this.\" Then BAM\u2014you overshoot the slide by 2 pixels, and now you\u2019re in a pit so deep it might as well be Hell itself. It\u2019s not just a fall. It\u2019s a soul-crushing, reality-shattering descent that takes your will to live and tosses it off the f*cking cliff along with your self-esteem.\n\nI screamed so loud during one fall that the neighbors knocked on the door to check if I was dying. I was, Brenda. I was dying inside. Every time I think I\u2019ve gotten better, that maybe I\u2019ve mastered the controls\u2014NOPE, the game hits me with a \"f*ck you\" swing that launches me from near the top all the way back to the f*cking tree at the very beginning like it's some kind of sick joke.\n\nAnd don't get me started on that f*cking anvil section. Whoever thought \"Hey, let\u2019s make a pointy piece of sh*t cliff with nothing but slippery rocks and hope\" should be jailed. In a pot. With a hammer. Forever.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just a game. It\u2019s an emotional purging ritual. It's like Bennett Foddy looked at the concept of hope and said, \"Let\u2019s make a game that sh*ts directly on that.\"\n\nF*ck this game. F*ck the pot. F*ck the hammer. F*ck the mountain. And f*ck whoever decided that mouse-only controls were a good idea for platforming.\n\nAnyway. I\u2019ll probably play it again tomorrow", 0.5419847369194031], ["Now you might be wondering why would someone ever spend more than hour in a rage game like Getting Over It? At first I had that same question  but I soon realized people don't care about the funny lookin cauldron man they care about Bennett. Some people may hate him but other love him, he's like your dad in the game. I couldn't stop playing once I heard his irresistible voice. Somedays I would open the game to hear Bennett's silky smooth voice tell me that I almost made to the top and his truly poetic words kept me from falling off the edge.
