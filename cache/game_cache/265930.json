Goat Simulator sits in the cannon alongside the greatest western artistic works such as the Sistine Chapel, the Mona Lisa, The Divine Comedy, Romeo & Juliet, Da Vinci's The Last Supper, Skibidi Toilet, Dostoevsky's Crimes And Punishment, and the cinematic works of the great filmmakers such as Tarkovsky, Kubrick, and Lynch as well as The Minecraft Movie. It really taps into the cultural zeitgeist of being a human living under late stage capitalism and the painful struggles for survival that the poor and working middle classes face when the goat says \"BAAAAAAA!!!!!\" We feel his RAGE living in a system designed to keep us down, as similar to the lyrics of The Smashing Pumpkins in their song \"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\" which says \"Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage.\"\n\n\nWhen David Lynch (RIP) said \u201cIdeas are like fish. If you want to catch little fish, you can stay in the shallow water. But if you want to catch the big fish, you've got to go deeper.
