Thats a lot but I was playing while working from home, dealing with a divorce and then a stroke and the time just added up. \nThis was my stress relief and I enjoyed most of the game. \n\nHowever:\n\n2 weeks ago my gaming PC broke and I began using Geforce Now to play instead. This was working fine until I began running out of play time. So I subbed to Shadow PC and tried to play there. \n\nAfter logging in one time, I was issued a perma ban for cheating. \n\nI appealed it, but it was denied almost immediately. \n\nI have never cheated in any game at all, and there is no way to communicate with anyone at amazon Games to dispute this. \n\nI loved this game, but play it at your own risk. The game is great, the support is non existent and possibly not even human.", 0.8922357559204102], ["The new gameplay and lore is much better than before, but locking the DLC from old players, that bought the game for 60\u20ac is just BS! New players can just buy the new edition for the same price and they receive everything, yet the ones who have been around since the beggining were cut aside from the newest contents. And for what I read and seen, it's not even worth the extra 30\u20ac.. \n\nI'm just gonna upvote it because I like the game in itself, but I don't approve this kind of disregard for player community", 0.8278945684432983], ["you wanna know a way to bring more people to the game.... lower the price on the game, the game was release 4 years ago and it's still at full price.", 0.8253987431526184], ["I\u2019m approaching 1000 hours in this game since its relaunch, and it\u2019s clear that the developers have little regard for it. Countless issues\u2014like visual bugs, broken mechanics, unbalanced gameplay, and aim lock\u2014are never addressed. Despite the vocal and passionate community, it feels like no one is ever listening to any concerns.\r\n\r\nThis game had so much potential but lacks any communication. The player base is quickly falling.", 0.6657348275184631], ["I think people are just too critical of what a game should be, I played this game since the alpha and beta stages, even when it was first release during covid times, when you had to wait for a 3 hour queue to get in game.\n\nI played many mmorpg games, and the thing that brings me back to this is the combat system and style. \n\nEarly Game and Mid game are amazing with the new and improved story lines which makes this game amazing.\n\nLate game, IMO is a little grindy but rewarding, that makes what MMORPG, level your gears, character, being accepted to wars, gorg raids, worm raids, invasions, M3 Mutateds, OPR, Arenas, Races.\n\nI think majority of gamers are complaining too much and want that fast hit of dopamine to get rewards without the grind. \n\nExplore hard enough, you will have plenty to do. =D", 0.6199250817298889], ["Do not purchase this game by Amazon Games unless you want to lose your money and time.  They will only take your money and then permanently ban your account after 5 months of play.  They will accuse you of using a 'cheating software.'  \n\nThe game isn't even on my computer, it's streamed from GeForce Now so any cheating software would be on their partner Nvidia's computer.  Maybe their partner Nvidia uses a 'cheating software'?  I don't know and Amazon Games don't care even if you do an appeal.\n\nAnyway there is a lot of farming so it is not worth spending all that time and money only to have it taken away.", 0.5977011322975159], ["I played this game at launch, and really loved it. I no lifed it for like 2 weeks until the fiasco started with chat bug sausages, immortality exploits and so on. \n\nI just came back after years, because I told myself \"this game was amazing, for sure they fixed the insane bugs right?\" and YES they did.\n\nAeternum is a waaaay more polished version of the original game. The Main Story Quest leveling is amazing, the new zones are amazing, new weapons are cool. Everything is just so much better. They made more niche changes that improved the game a lot, which a total noob will not see, for example healers would stay in heavy armor and be immortal. That is not a thing anymore because you get -30% healing when you are in heavy.\n\nHousing system is nice, crafting is nice, gathering is really satisfying. They made these interesting sounds when you kill something or when you gather, kinda like Battlefield or other FPS \"clink\" sound, which is very addictive.\n\nOpen world PvP is just insane and I started a regional war just last night because I was camped by 6 purple dudes. Called in the boys and it was a literal battlefield. In what MMORPG can you hide in bushes, making your name plate disappear? You can ambush people!\n\nHonestly, people are trashing the game too much and that's just because modern gamers are delusional. You see people with 5k+ hours, even 10k stating that \"the game is bad\" because there is no content. Bro...I don't have 10k hours in dota2 and I play it since 2013. There is a lot of content, and you have a certain freedom other MMO's don't provide.\nThere is no treadmill like WoW.\n\nThe devs make some mistakes but whatever, my server is packed, content everywhere and it looks/feels amazing. Play this game!", 0.58798748254776], ["With over 400 hours spent in New World, I can say this game has been a rollercoaster of exploration, experimentation, and evolution. What first pulled me in was the sheer beauty of Aeternum and the weighty, satisfying feel of its combat system. Over time, what kept me coming back was the depth of the crafting system, the sense of progression, and the moments of large-scale conflict that actually felt meaningful. There have been ups and downs, and the game has changed quite a bit since launch, but watching it grow and improve has been part of the experience. Whether I was gathering resources deep in the wilderness, fighting alongside others in intense wars, or simply refining my build for the next challenge, New World always gave me something to sink my time into. It is not a perfect MMO, but it has a soul and a rhythm that resonates with players who enjoy investing themselves in a world that rewards patience, adaptability, and persistence.", 0.5645816922187805], ["Unfortunately, the game is too dull, and boring.\nIt's worth something about $15.\nI recommend trying other mmos, like BDO, or ESO.", 0.5562599301338196], ["The game-play and mechanics make this such a great combat focused MMO. Combine that with great visuals and audio, this could be a game i would sink so much time into but once you complete the fairly average story there is nothing to do! You cant grind dungeons because there is no one doing them and the side quests provide no real rewards. The PVP has 1 map for both its modes and becomes so boring. Its also hard to fill a PVP lobby but when it does you only face the hardcore sweats with all the best gear they obtained years ago. \n\nThere is no other combat focused game that plays as well as this, its just a shame the content and endgame sucks.
