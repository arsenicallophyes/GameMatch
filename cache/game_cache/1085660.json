Now it's effectively entirely paid-for content, drip fed and time-gated to limit your experience, and competitive scene is inundated with blatant cheaters with no intention from the devs to change anything.

Smooth gunplay, amazing visuals, immersive atmosphere. I genuinely enjoyed playing it with my friend. No cheating, no griefing, no toxicity. Just the two of us doing missions and having fun.\n\nThen out of nowhere came a permanent restriction. No warning, no explanation. I submitted two detailed and respectful appeals. In return, I got the usual copy-paste response saying I violated policies, with no actual detail about what happened.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the only possible reason was one sarcastic message I sent to my friend in a private chat. Just the two of us. It wasn\u2019t public, no one could report it, and it wasn\u2019t even serious. Just a dumb joke.\n\nAnd yet Bungie decided that was enough to ban me permanently. No warning. No temporary mute. Not even a short suspension. Just a lifetime ban for one harmless line in a private chat that no one saw or complained about.\n\nI get it, rules are rules. But this is ridiculous. No other major AAA studio would hand out a permanent ban for something like that. A short mute maybe, a brief suspension possibly, but a permanent ban for one line? That says more about Bungie than it does about any actual violation.\n\nDestiny 2 might be a great game, but the way Bungie treats regular players is honestly disgraceful.", 0.5424836277961731], ["Sunk too many hours into this game, both console and PC. The first few words i have to type so that my review may somewhat be worthy of your time... that felt stupid to type. Anyways, game has great gameplay experience. I met some great people, felt accomplished in pvp, beta tested the gambit mode, and a great story with great lore... that was like 6 years ago. That all changed.\n\nGameplay is still great but the social experience today is doo doo. Whats that, you wanna do a raid? Cool, first you must know what to do (KWTD), then you must have insert meta weapon/armor loadout, and then prepare to deal with whinny crybabies who's time you're wasting because you're not as good as them. Oh and somehow you must have experience in said raid and YT tutorials don't count.\n\nMeh, that can be avoided and you can decide, \"hey, I don't want to play with strangers, I'll try out pvp instead\". Know that pvp resources are most if not all, allocated to bungies new ip, marathon. So if pvp gets too boring, you're SOL.\n\n Thats fine, maybe try out gambit... know that its been years since that feature got an overhaul.  \n\nAll fine, just do the numerous slightly rewarding activities that may drop that great god roll weapon that the paid YT influencers recommend... wait, its useless now? I got nerfed? Thats right. That god roll weapon the same paid YT influencers praise then beg for its nerf, may one day just get the unjust nerf or even be removed from the game. Something you paid for, if you actually bought the game via its plethora of DLC.\n\nIgnore all of that, play the game for its rich story and fascinating lore... that is also constantly retconed. Thats right. Even the lore channel content creators have a problem with this. \n\nIts all up to you, reader of this slightly buzzed and depressed gamer's review.

This game is an overwhelming experience for new players, not in the good, content-rich way, but in a \"here\u2019s a hundred icons and no explanation\" kind of way.\r\n\r\nThe game throws you into the middle of a confusing story with no real introduction, tutorial, or guidance on where to go or what to care about. Systems are layered on top of each other with minimal context, menus are bloated and unintuitive, and unless you\u2019re ready to read third-party guides or watch hours of YouTube tutorials, it\u2019s hard to find your footing.\r\n\r\nIt feels like a game designed for long-time players, not newcomers. That\u2019s fine, but it should be clearer up front.

I HOPE EA BUYS YOU TO SHUT YOU DOWN YOU TRASHY COMPANY", 0.5068965554237366], ["Love the game, genuinely some of the most fun gameplay, coolest quests, and most interesting writing in the gaming industry. Literally cannot advise AGAINST starting it harder. I promise, if you haven't been playing since launch, there is no reason to start playing now.\r\n\r\nLets say you get the base game, it's free, and looks good, cool. You're gonna run out of things to do in like 2 weeks, if you even last that long, because without all the DLC they don't even really give you a reason to do anything. It's all just ~there~ and you're expected to just sift through it.\r\n\r\nSo, okay, lets get some DLC so you have some stories to chew on and something actually worth doing. I hope you have $170 just sitting around to dump on a \"free\" game, maybe not all at once, sure that works. Well first you wanna make sure you get the forsaken pack, that's a given, so there's $20. Now to start with the ACTUALLY PLAYABLE DLCs which are... about $30... Each... Lets do Shadowkeep to start, that's ones only $20! Oh? You finished the story in 2 days? Alright cool, just buy beyond light for another $20, and then the witch queen for $30, and then LightFall for another $30 and the 30th anniversary pack for $25 and- oh shit we've already spent spent $145...? huh... Well that's okay it's a free game! plus you can always just skip this process and get the Legacy collection for $70 which is actually a pretty good deal!\r\n\r\nBut once you finish all of the stories and content that adds in what, a month? Maybe less if you take to the mechanics fast? Well then you're staring down the barrel of the final shape, which is another $50 for JUST it's content or $100 for the bundle with the season pass which if you're still here you're probably gonna want because of the amount of content and story and items you can get for it.\r\n\r\nSo conservatively, the \"barrier of entry\" to access everything this FREE GAME has to offer is about $170 give or take. Not counting silver for cosmetics if that's your jam. And even after all that, you don't even actually GET the \"full game\" because over half of it is still just GONE! You can NEVER get the full context for everything going on because there are entire campaigns just MISSING! Whole storylines with CRUCIAL CONTEXT are just missing from the game and they're likely NEVER COMING BACK. Sure, they've made great strides in bringing back items from that time, but as far as I can tell they will NEVER let us play those questlines again!\r\n\r\nSo, to refresh. this FREE GAME is going to pressure you into spending $170 to access what's LEFT of the content it has to offer, to start reading the book like 10 chapters in after they ripped out all the pages before that and left behind 2 bits of paper with sparknotes on them, waste hours or days struggling to get achievements that are literally not achievable anymore because the content required to get them DOES NOT EXIST, to wait ages in loading screens only to play missions with half the usual players thanks to a shrinking player-base wasting away on life-support, while they squeeze you for every penny that can possibly be manipulated out of you, while they drown you in \"episodes\" that are 90% just standing in an area while listening in on a group voice chat between in-game characters between missions that are identical to literally every other mission in the game.\r\n\r\nI love destiny 2, I've been playing since launch, before I moved my destiny account here from battlenet I had about the same hours I do on here, so total my hours are nearing 3k. I think despite it's abysmally low-lows the story/stories told in the game are some of the best in the industry, the balancing when it's good is some of the most rewarding of any game on the market, and I think genuinely there isn't anything else like Destiny 2 out there.\r\n\r\nBut I cannot, WILL not, ever in good conscience recommend starting Destiny 2 in 2025. Maybe a few years ago during shadowkeep or beyond light it would have felt less bad to recommend it, but nowadays? Unless you're willing to put up with one of the worst \"new-player\" experiences available today, and you have hundreds of dollars you just HAVE to spend as fast as possible?\r\n\r\nSTAY. AWAY. Save yourself. It's too late for the rest of us, we're here forever. I'm writing this review fresh off playing again for a few days after taking a 320ish day break. I came back because I missed my graviton lance  voidlock build and wanted to experience it again. This game will have it's hooks in me for probably ever, but if you're on the fence about getting into destiny 2 I implore to to turn and run for the hills. \r\n\r\nYou can check out any time you like.
