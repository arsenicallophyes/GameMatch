It is WELL worth it tho. at 80 hours roughly, I still crash a lot, but I can actually throw the bike around and put some good lap times down. If you like Moto games, this game is so worth it. just understand, the first few hours playing will be very difficult but if you stick with it, the game gets soo damn rewarding. Lastly, the Mods, sooo many free mods. tracks, bike paints, gear, etc. you name it theres probably a mod.

Gotta have Mods for it to be worth it, but they're pretty easy enough to install.  Look up Reaperdoc on YT for instructional videos on getting started.", 0.5454545617103577], ["MX Bikes isn\u2019t your typical motocross game. If you\u2019re coming from arcade-style titles like MX vs ATV or Monster Energy Supercross, prepare for a steep learning curve\u2014but also a far more rewarding ride. This game is built for realism.\r\n\r\nEvery movement, from shifting your rider's weight to controlling throttle mid-air, affects the bike\u2019s physics. It's not about holding down the throttle and flying off jumps\u2014it's about finesse. Body positioning, clutch use, traction control, and even suspension behavior all come into play.\r\n\r\nThat attention to realism makes MX Bikes feel closer to an actual motocross simulation than any other title on the market. It's brutal at first, but once you \"get it,\" the immersion and satisfaction are unmatched.\r\n\r\n\ud83e\udde0 Physics \u2013 The Star of the Show\r\nThe physics engine is what makes MX Bikes truly shine. The bikes react dynamically to terrain, rider inputs, and weight distribution. Unlike many games where your bike feels like it's on rails, here it's like you're actually taming a powerful 2-stroke or 4-stroke beast.\r\n\r\nCornering requires precise body lean and throttle modulation. Jumps aren't just about speed\u2014they\u2019re about balance, preload, and correct take-off angles. Mistime anything, and you\u2019ll wash out, loop out, or slam into the ground.\r\n\r\nIt's punishing, yes, but incredibly authentic. Once mastered, scrubbing a jump or railing a berm feels amazing.\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf0d Tracks \u2013 Realistic Terrain and Customizability\r\nOut of the box, MX Bikes comes with a handful of official tracks, but the modding community is where this game comes alive. Thanks to an active user base, you have access to hundreds of custom tracks, including real-life replicas and fantasy courses. Tracks vary in traction, elevation, and even soil type (hardpack, sand, loam, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe terrain deformation system is a standout feature. As you ride laps, the track gets rougher\u2014ruts form, braking bumps develop, and lines change. No two motos are the same, especially in multiplayer.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Mods \u2013 The Lifeblood of the Game\r\nMX Bikes has a thriving modding scene that fills in the gaps left by its small development team. Mods include:\r\n\r\nCustom bikes (2-strokes, 4-strokes, OEM replicas)\r\n\r\nRider gear, helmets, and boots\r\n\r\nTracks from across the world\r\n\r\nPhysics tweaks\r\n\r\nUI overhauls\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a full ecosystem built by the community, with sites like MXB-Mods.com hosting thousands of high-quality downloads. Installing mods is fairly straightforward, and some tools make it even easier.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc65 Multiplayer \u2013 Competitive & Fun (with a Few Hiccups)\r\nOnline racing is a blast\u2014if you can find a good server. Netcode is decent for a small-scale sim, though still not perfect. Expect the occasional lag spike or disconnection, but overall, multiplayer adds a ton of replay value. From casual freerides to organized race leagues, there's plenty to get involved in.\r\n\r\nVoice chats and Discord communities help coordinate events, and some leagues even simulate full seasons with points, heat races, and qualifying rounds.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Graphics & Performance \u2013 Functional, Not Flashy\r\nLet\u2019s be honest: MX Bikes isn\u2019t going to win any awards for visuals. Graphics are serviceable, not stunning. The textures and models are a bit outdated by modern standards, especially compared to AAA racers.\r\n\r\nHowever, the game runs well even on mid-tier hardware, and the modding community improves the visual fidelity with better shaders, lighting, and track objects. What you lose in flash, you gain in performance and customizability.\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf9a\ufe0f Controls \u2013 Bring a Controller (or Better Yet, a Wheel Stand)\r\nMX Bikes was built with precision in mind. Keyboard play is technically possible but strongly discouraged. A controller (Xbox or DualShock) is the minimum requirement for a decent experience, but the real pros use dual analog sticks + triggers, and even custom handlebars or sim rigs for immersion.\r\n\r\nThe control mapping is fully customizable, including independent rider and bike control. It's complex but allows for total control over the machine.\r\n\r\n\ud83e\udded Learning Curve \u2013 Steep but Worth It\r\nMX Bikes doesn\u2019t hold your hand. There are no tutorials or onboarding missions\u2014you\u2019ll probably crash a hundred times before completing a clean lap. But once it clicks, the depth of control and realism make it incredibly addictive.\r\n\r\nThere are community-made guides and YouTube tutorials to help new riders, and you'll need them. This is not a casual game, but for those who stick with it, it\u2019s the best feeling motocross game you\u2019ll ever play.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udd1a Final Verdict\r\nMX Bikes is not perfect. It has bugs. The UI is clunky. The graphics are outdated. And the learning curve is unforgiving. But if you\u2019re looking for the most realistic, physics-driven motocross simulator available, this is it.\r\n\r\nOnce you break through the initial wall, MX Bikes offers a deep, authentic, and endlessly rewarding experience\u2014backed by a passionate community and near-infinite customization.", 0.5300449728965759], ["good game, fun great physichs", 0.523809552192688], ["Great game, probably the best MX game out there atm ... mods are simple with plenty of tutorial videos if needed, wish there was a campaign mode and the original menu,bikes,gear are not great.
