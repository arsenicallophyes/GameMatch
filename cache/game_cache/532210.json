That\u2019s not to say it isn\u2019t good\u2014because it really is. The journey of Sean and Daniel is powerful, full of heart and difficult choices, and it explores themes like brotherhood, identity, and survival in a way that\u2019s raw and deeply moving. The writing is strong, the art style is familiar and comforting, and the moral weight of your decisions is as heavy as ever. But despite all that, it didn\u2019t quite leave the same lasting imprint that Max and Chloe\u2019s story did. Still, if you love narrative-driven games or the Life is Strange series in general, it\u2019s definitely worth playing.", 0.523809552192688], ["the game is absolutely amazing. life of strange 2 is definitely the best of all the LiS , although the graphics aren't the best i think that adds a lot to the charm of the game a brilliant game with 5 more endings than the 1st", 0.5187115669250488], ["best LIS game out of the series, 10/10 experience, didn't expect it to be this emotional and heavy", 0.5045104622840881], ["Man i really slept longer on this one than i should have. For sure worth a chance by anyone curious. I wasn't sold quite yet until i got into episode two then suddenly i cared a ton about these characters. These games are all a bit corny and extreme sometimes , which most know the type of game to expect when playing any lis games. To people who don't might not give it a chance to build the scenario, underneath the extreme ways it gets its story moving is meaningful perspectives on different lives. The way it drags you into the insane emotional decisions of the characters that feel real somewhere( without powers) . The responsibility of trying to still guide your younger brother to be a good person and do the right thing in such an unfair world is kind of what i imagine having kids is like. Mad respect to people with kiddos. That pressure is low key really scary. The game really makes you believe you yourself are in this situation and you start really thinking hard about whats the right move for not only yourself but people around you. I'm telling you , something about this one.", 0.5023923516273499], ["I am a lonely wolf unlike sean , Ill do everything for the people i love , even if they dont want me to , recommended 10/10 experience my ending .... i wont heal from it ever ig", 0.5], ["I consider myself a fan of choice-based games, and among many of them, I feel a deep connection with Life is Strange 2. I believe this game resonates with my life due to the various situations and decisions one must face, and the consequences that come with them. It reflects the responsibility and weight a person must carry in life. It\u2019s a calm and slow-paced game, yet it delivers a powerful message, touching on sensitive topics that are still relevant today\u2014and likely will continue to be. If you\u2019re going to play it, make sure to pay attention to everything around you and to the dialogues. With that said, I hope you enjoy this game as much as I did.", 0.5], ["It's a great game.

Has a road trip feel to this adventure.", 0.5], ["Life is Strange 2 is not a bad game overall, but it definitely has its flaws. Sometimes the story has really silly moments, and some choices lead to strange or unrealistic consequences. Compared to the first game, the second part feels weaker and less impactful. That said, it\u2019s still a decent experience, especially if you're into narrative-driven games. A lot of the game depends on the younger brother, which can be interesting but also frustrating at times.", 0.5], ["I absolutely love this game! The story is so engaging, and you get super attached to Sean and Daniel. Their journey is emotional, intense, and full of tough choices that really make you think.

Besides Tell Me Why, this is my favorite LIS game ever. Love the story of Sean and Daniel Diaz. Only LIS game that made me cry like a baby, and I can relate to to Sean on so many levels myself. Beautiful game, beautiful soundtracks, as with all LIS games, and excellent writing, and I also like the upgraded graphics. Those who hate on this, calling it too woke or political are the very people who are the reason these brothers became wanted fugitives in the 1st place.
