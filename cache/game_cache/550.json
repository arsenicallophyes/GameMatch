Over the years it has never gotten old, though the nostalgia factor does tend to help a lot. The Left 4 Dead community as a whole has done a masterful job of keeping the game alive through countless mods, including custom campaigns, for whenever you need a fresh take on the classic. While the bots do tend to be a bit dumb and not very helpful, there are many awesome mods to modify their AI to make them less frustrating, and give you a human-like playing experience. Additionally, I feel L4D was very ahead of its time, because of its unique AI called the \"Director\". Instead of a copy-and-paste experience for every campaign playthrough, the Director makes it so that the game dynamics (infected, items, pacing, spawn points) all vary based on the player's skill and current status.
