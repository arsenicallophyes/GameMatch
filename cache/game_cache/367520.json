Real bugs\ud83d\udc1b\ud83d\udc1e\ud83d\udc1d\ud83e\udd97\ud83e\udd8b\r\nBought the game because of its reputation, it lived up to that reputation implied. \r\nI was lost at first because the game doesn't tell you where to go or what to do, no map at the initial stage. Was super confused so I just jumped around, fought a few bugs, collected badges, learnt a new skill, next time I noticed the clock was 2am. What's wrong with me.\r\n\r\nIf you explore the game thoroughly you can sink hundreds of hours into it. Lots of secrets, NPCs, badges, skills and enemies to collect and discover (I love that). You can see the devs have put a lot of effort into making this game by its astonishing content.\r\nIt's a steal even buying it at full price\ud83d\udcb2. I feel sorry (well not that sorry) I bought it at 50% off.\r\n\r\nPS. Parkour in this game is freaking hard, imo harder than boss fight.\r\nPPS. \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89Heard that Silksong is coming in 2025. Hype me up.\ud83e\udd42", 0.856758177280426], ["300 hours. All achievements. These numbers don't even begin to scratch the surface of my experience with Hollow Knight. This wasn't just a game I played; it was a world I inhabited, a journey I poured my heart into. From the moment I stepped into Hallownest's melancholic beauty, I was captivated.\r\n\r\nThe sheer artistry is breathtaking. Every pixel, every animation, every haunting melody breathes life into this decaying kingdom. The atmosphere is thick with mystery, a palpable sense of loss and wonder that pulls you deeper with each step. But it's not just pretty; it's challenging, rewarding, and deeply, deeply satisfying.\r\n\r\nThe combat is a dance of precise timing and skillful parrying. Each boss battle felt like a personal triumph, a testament to my patience and dedication. The exploration is unparalleled; every hidden nook and cranny holds a secret, a treasure, a piece of the puzzle that is Hallownest's tragic history. I found myself constantly losing myself in its intricate map, always discovering something new, something breathtaking.\r\n\r\nMore than just a game, Hollow Knight is an experience. It's a testament to the power of atmosphere, the thrill of challenge, and the beauty of exploration. It's a game that has stayed with me long after I 'completed' it, a world I still revisit in my thoughts. If you're looking for a game that will challenge you, move you, and leave a lasting impression, look no further.

This is absolutely a super fun game that I would recommend to any fan of Metroidvania style games AS LONG AS you're ready for a REALLY tough challenge.  There are some challenges towards the end of the game that will REALLY test your patience but as long as you're persistent, you'll find the right means of dealing with the obstacles and bosses that you'll face.  \n\nDefinitely lives up to the hype in terms of super tight gameplay and very well done visuals that have a timeless look about it that will most certainly age well over time.
