Even though I\u2019ve always loved zombie games, this one just didn\u2019t grab my attention. I was deep into State of Decay at the time, which is a solid zombie game in its own right. But eventually, I started feeling like it was a bit limited. I wanted more freedom, more challenge.\r\n\r\nThen one day, while I was watching YouTube, a video about Project Zomboid popped up. And holy hell\u2026 this game is insane. I couldn\u2019t believe I had been ignoring such a gem just because the graphics didn\u2019t look as flashy as other games. But let me tell you \u2014 this game is absolutely amazing. It\u2019s fun, intense, and delivers everything I\u2019ve ever wanted in a zombie survival game.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s what makes it so great:\r\n\r\n1. Total freedom \u2014 You can do whatever you want. You create your own story, make your own choices, and the game just lets you go wild.\r\n\r\n2. Challenging in the best way \u2014 It\u2019s super realistic. Injuries, status effects, and survival mechanics all make the game feel tense and rewarding.\r\n\r\n3. Modding community is top-tier \u2014 If there\u2019s something in the game that bugs you, chances are someone\u2019s already made a mod to fix or improve it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re into zombie survival games, don\u2019t let the graphics fool you.

I've logged 240 hours in 6 weeks (I never log hours in a game like this). It's open ended, you choose your own path, and incredibly sandbox. The modding community is extensive and the Devs update the game every 1-2 weeks like clockwork. They listen to community feedback and honor their community to the fullest, you just don't see that too often these days. I will say if you're planning to mod this game, I hope you have lots of RAM. 16gb isn't enough... \r\n\r\nIf I had to critique this game, I would say my biggest problem with this game is there's no end-game or ultimate goal. Sure you can max out your levels (massive grind) or you could set self goals like clearing Louisville (good luck) but that's all up to you to enforce that upon yourself. And achieving those long term goals ultimately gets you nothing in the end other than saying you did it. I wish this was treated more like a dungeon crawler like Hades instead of a solely sandbox survival game. It even starts each run by saying \"and this is how you died\" so logically that is the point. So why not get a score? Like number of kills, levels, rare items found, and time survived multiplied by negative traits. Then your score can can be added up in your account. Maybe scores can unlock new items for future runs or items to be used in multiplayer servers. I'm not a dev, just an idea. \r\n\r\nMy other critique would be the poor performance. Especially when its raining. It can be so bad that players consider rain a death sentence due to the lag and stuttering. I have a very high end desktop (7800x3d, 7900xtx, and 32gb ram) and this game is still a stuttery mess with my frame times jumping around constantly. And the issue is optimization because my hardware is barely being utilized, maybe peaking at 40% on the GPU and 30% on the CPU. This is annoying, but this is a small Dev so I understand the struggles here. \r\n\r\nLast critique is no cloud save support. And this is because of how the game is optimized and uses memory. You might think \"well that sucks, but I can just manually transfer my save to my laptop and continue playing on the go\". And sure, you can until you start really exploring the whole world and have 40+ mods installed. My save file for my longest running save is over 400Mb, almost half a gig. And that save file is 10s of thousands of tiny files. Last time I transferred my save (not doing this anymore) it took an HOUR. Having a NVMe SSD like me doesn't matter when there's so many tiny files that need to be transferred. \r\n\r\nI know it sounds like I'm railing this game, but I still love it and I think that just goes to show just how good it is. I'd say if you read this whole review and were wondering if this game is worth it, IT IS. It's not too expensive and will give you so much enjoyment, give it a shot!", 0.523809552192688], ["game good, survival good, mechanic good. two zombie chase is fine, 4+ zombie chase is kill\r\nsoundtrack good, graphic is runescape horror", 0.523809552192688], ["This is one of the most enjoyable game but it can get repetative and is only fun with others", 0.523809552192688], ["Dakilolpis\n132 products in account\n5 reviews\n\nRecommended\n65.0 hrs on record\nEARLY ACCESS REVIEW\nPOSTED: 19 MARCH\nProject Zomboid is one of the greatest survival games ever made. From its incredible depth to its brilliantly designed mechanics, this game sets the gold standard for what a true survival experience should be. It\u2019s realistic, immersive, moddable, and most importantly, a hell of a lot of fun.\n\nEvery aspect of Project Zomboid feels grounded and believable. This isn\u2019t just a game about killing zombies\u2014it\u2019s about long-term survival, resource management, and adapting to a world that wants you dead. Whether it\u2019s dealing with injuries, managing food and water, or fortifying a safehouse, the attention to detail is insane.\n\nThe combat is engaging and rewarding. Every swing of a bat, every perfectly timed push, and every last-ditch escape feels intense and strategic. There\u2019s no mindless button-mashing here\u2014positioning, stamina, and awareness all matter. The fact that hordes actually feel like a real threat adds a level of tension that few other games can replicate. Survival isn\u2019t just about fighting\u2014it\u2019s about building your future. Watching your character progress over time\u2014gaining skills, becoming stronger, and mastering the apocalypse\u2014is incredibly rewarding. The base-building system is flexible and fun, allowing you to fortify an existing house or create a fortress from scratch.\n\nThe world is massive, detailed, and full of life (or death). The game\u2019s art style is simple yet incredibly effective, creating an eerie, immersive atmosphere that complements the gameplay perfectly.\n\nOne of the best parts? The modding community is insane. The game is already amazing, but the ability to tweak and enhance it with mods just makes it even better.\n\nUnlike many modern games, Project Zomboid listens to its community. The developers actually care about player feedback, and it shows. This game is worth every single cent I spent on it.\n\nThe Only Downside? Car Lag\nIf I had to nitpick, the only annoying thing is the lag when driving fast. But honestly? That\u2019s a minor issue in an otherwise flawless game.\n\nFinal Verdict: A Must-Play Survival Masterpiece\nProject Zomboid is a godsend for survival fans. It\u2019s deep, intense, rewarding, and endlessly replayable. More developers should take notes from this game, because this is how you make a true survival experience. If you haven\u2019t played it yet, do yourself a favor and get it.\n \nWas this review helpful?\n Yes\n \n No\n \n Funny\n \n Award\n36 people found this review helpful", 0.52173912525177], ["It's fun for what it is.
