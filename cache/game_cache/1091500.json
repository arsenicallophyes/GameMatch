It's not perfect, but it is an incredible experience the whole way through. \nAmazing storytelling, amazing characters, amazing locations, amazing endings.\nIt is just so insane to me that this game went from being a buggy unfinished mess to an experience that is hard to get from any other game,\nI found myself thinking of Night City as a thing instead of a location. A horrible city which does everything it can to stop people from escaping. Kinda reminded me of the town from Uzumaki. \nIt also has insane replayability, I only did 2 playthroughs but you can get countless more with so many different builds. \nSomething I love is how your actions can change outcomes of certain things. Whether that's certain quests changing or just dialogue, I love it. Adds so much to the immersion, it really feels like V exists in Night City. One of my favourite things to do at the end of my runs is visit the graveyard. Names are added throughout the game as characters die. It's nice to walk through at the end and remember all the previous quests and people you've met.\nI truly wish this game released as it is now, it's incredible. It's just a shame it still has a bad reputation with some people after all this time.\nI'll never forget this game. I'm looking forward to future projects like a second anime, and whatever the next game is going to be. I hope its set in Night City but improved. I'd love to see their vision realised after all this time in the next game.\nThank you so much CDPR for this beautiful experience, this game will stick with me for the rest of my life.", 0.7550788521766663], ["Cyberpunk 2077, An open-world RPG set in the futuristic world of Night City in the cyberpunk universe. To convey about this title is enormous, because of how big it is and the content it has. CP2077 is often used for GPU benchmarks and stress tests, so i don't need to say much about how good the game is graphically. Gameplay is amazing especially the gun play, and the vast build choices in the game gives plenty of options for players with different playstyles.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3435052281\nThe main story of the title is actually short, too short because of how big the world it's set in. It's like a 30min conversation of 3hr movie. Also there's no NG+ which is a big letdown imo especially when the game has good replayability. The plot didn't felt that great but still really good, the characters and side contents are exceptional. But in the end felt like the story really needs more appreciation after exploring every endings. Sound tracks are good except for a few of them those were better than good. The World of Night City is something else, CDPR did an excellent job making the world. It's really immersive with all the gangs, chaos, corrupted system, crowded NPCs etc.. And ofc a great sight indeed, yet another gorgeous game world. Still there are lots the game lacks that were once promised by the devs and was already there.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3448157934\nThe RPG didn't felt that strong in the game as in like their previous title Witcher 3, but it was fine. CDPR nailed it with character creation, good work with both male and female V. For a custom created character they really make us emotional and the voice acting was top notch especially FemV. The photo mode in CP2077 is outstanding, and arguably the best game ever there is for great Virtual Photography. The DLC expansion Phantom Liberty succeeded in every way. It's plot, branching of storylines according to player choices, characters, new region, and the side contents that comes with it. It also includes many useful rewards and items.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3459037759\nHave no idea if I missed anything here, after all it's a huge title.

I played it after all the updates and honestly? It\u2019s a whole different vibe than what people joked about at launch. You play as V, a merc in Night City, trying to survive in a wild, tech heavy future where body upgrades are normal and loyalty\u2019s rare. The base game is already stacked with intense missions, insane customization, and choices that actually hit hard later on. The atmosphere? Straight cyber future chaos with a side of lusty neon drama. And Johnny Silverhand (Keanu Reeves) constantly roasting you in your head? Iconic. But Phantom Liberty? that DLC hits like crack. It throws you into Dogtown, a darker and more intense part of Night City. The story centers around Songbird (So Mi), a netrunner with major secrets. She\u2019s such a well written character, and the more you get to know her, the more you're torn between helping her or questioning everything. The emotional weight she brings to the story? I just can't describe. If you're playing both? definitely finish Phantom Liberty before heading into the main story\u2019s epilogue. Trust me, it adds so much depth. If you\u2019re into futuristic chaos, deep characters, and emotional decisions, this combo\u2019s a must play.

I recall hearing so many ugly things about the game when all we saw were snippets within trailers. A lot of folks seemed pissed due to presumptions and perceptions they held. \n\nWhen the game launched on PC, it definitely had bugs. Though I didn't experience any that were game breaking, there were many minor issues. Emphasis on 'were'. I only recently played on Steam Deck and it runs nicely there, though my poor little Deck does sound like it's trying to take flight. Anyway, CD Projekt Red has done a bang up job of making this game run much more smoothly. That's not to say it's perfect. However, I no longer experience anything more than a minimal quirk once in a blue moon. \n\nFor the story? 10/10. I get hooked every time I boot it up. The side quests are interesting and many are challenging. The characters are varied and range from quirky to radical. A few are almost even wholesome, as much as one can be in this setting. The BS we get put through as 'V' is insane, and it seems everyone in Night City has their own Bag of Cats with which to contend. The choices we have to pick between, the risks we take, none are ideal. And yet, it fits. There is no 'ideal', not in Night City.\n\nI could probably say a lot more about this game, and it would all boil down to this: If you like the cyberpunk genre and RPGs, especially those that get your blood pumping, I recommend this game. \n\nNo spoilers, but make sure you pick up some cat food. \n\n", 0.54356849193573], ["I'll keep it short.  At launch, this game was hot garbage.  Now?  It's great.  Did it fall short of the unreachable standards established by nearly eight years of waiting followed by the biggest hype train I have ever seen?  \n\nObviously...yes.  However I find it to be an exceptional game regardless.  And they didn't just fix up the base game, they put out some pretty big updates like the 2.0 update that released alongside the expansion, adding new content and revamping some old content. \n\nThe expansion I think is even better than the base game.  I can't quite put my finger on why, but me and my work friend both recently played it and she agreed that Phantom Liberty's story and map are just... better.  Perhaps it's because they feel more focused.\n\nIf I had any complaints, it would be that there's no third person, dealing with Jackie Welles and Johnny Silverhand feels like a chore to me, Phantom Liberty seemed to be setting up new romances and then just didn't (cut content?), and Panam Palmer didn't climb out of my screen and maul me.\n\nIt's a really solid FPS/RPG with an expansive story, lots of side content, fun combat, great character customization (that you can only see in mirrors, menus, and motorcycles...), two solid romances (Panam and Judy), and fun driving with a large variety of vehicles.
