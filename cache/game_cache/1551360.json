Very fun, with or without friends. Many cars available, huge map. It's perfect for just wanting to relax and drive/race. I haven't played any of the previous installments in the series, so, I can't compare them on which one is better or not. But overall, it's a nice little game. Worth the price (for the Standard Edition), although, I would recommend buying the Premium Edition on sale.

The progression system sucks. Instead of starting the game with the lowest class of car and working your way up higher and higher on the performance ladder, the game starts you out with 3 cars that sit in the upper middle section of performance classes. Having cars that start at A and B class ratings invalidates classes C and D outside of experimenting for fun several dozen hours into the game. There's also the wheel spin system of level-up rewards that makes leveling up feel less rewarding. Instead of starting at 5-20k dollar rewards and, as you play, increasing this to higher value cars and greater cash rewards, there is a chance that the level up reward for reaching 20 is a Ferrari FXX and the level reward for reaching level 80 is 20k dollars. It doesn't make me get excited for leveling up as it kinda kills the idea of progressing rewards for progressing levels. All of this led me to feeling like I have \"completed\" the game 5-10 hours into the game after I got a S2 class supercar through the wheel spin relatively early on. A car that would usually be rewarded in the last few \"levels\" of other racing games, found its way into my hands as I was still beginning. I felt great that I had gotten so lucky, but after a while it kinda killed my drive to keep playing as much as I had. The game is still fun on a purely driving basis, and I can imagine it is even more fun with friends; but the idea of random progression rewards turns you off, there are probably other options available.", 0.5396621227264404], ["I can't stand the cutscenes in this game.

Checked the (mostly useless) online setup guides and tested their settings however the underlying controller interface is not sufficiently flexible to tune out the yaw without deadening (and substantially degrading) the overall steering performance.\n\nMight work with a controller, however I purchased it in the hope of being able to drive cars in a semi-arcade / semi-simulation mode using a wheel and pedals. During the \"refund window\" most of the game time was spent yawing from one side of the track to the other and ending up backwards.\n\nDespite lots of bump vibration through the FFB wheel the actual engagement between the vehicle and the track is remote and lacking in any real road feel. If the car behaved more in an arcade mode (i.e. did not enter excessive yaw oscillation at the slightest provocation) this lack of track engagement would not be so much of an issue. However in the current case the lack of track engagement, and the tendency to oscillate wildly at the slightest provocation, the overwhelming sensation is one of lack of control.\n\nThis means the game sits uncomfortably between \"arcade\" and \"simulation\" modes. It is neither accurate enough to even approach a \"simulation\" nor unrealistic enough to perform well as an \"arcade\" style driving game.\n\nRequested a refund.\n\nLooks like it is back to Assetto Corsa (surprisingly good car simulation) or iRacing...\n\n", 0.5265279412269592], ["Good luck even logging into this game.
