I am not saying it is wrong or bad in general, it is just not my cup of tea anymore.\n\n- Ingame Voip and Chat not working properly\n- UI Functions to equip your hunter are sometimes not working correctly\n- Sound Bugs (sometimes a major inconvienience in a game that is designed for great audio)\n- Server Performance sometimes randomly goes to hell with rubberbanding out of nowhere and lagging.\n- Texture Loading Bugs and Derendering of walls or trees\n- Reconnect Feature not working \n- Ingame map bugging and leading to stutters\n\nAnd so on. Most of this is not the worst thing but in combination in intense situations it becomes very frustrating because this stuff happens often.\n\nThe Devs started to improve on communication again which I highly appreciate even though it is by far not as good as it was a few years ago.\n\nThe biggest issues that are making me leaving the game more and more are the following:\n\n- The Instaburning meta.\n\nFor those who dont know. When you get killed in Hunt, your team mates can pick you up a few times and you loose part of your maximum health for every revive until you are at zero maximum health and red skulled. Then you can not be picked up again (besided when your team has the bounty, the main objective of the game). But even then they have to sacrifice their own health to get you back). When you are downed and people set you on fire, you rapidly loose your maximum health until you are redskulled.\n\nI hated it when they implemented burning downed hunters long ago. But I see from a gamedesign perspective, that they needed some sort of mechanic to handle solos with self revive and stalemates from people that are just hiding and waiting until you leave, to pick up their team mates again. And I think it was fine how it was. But the devs decided not so long ago that it was not enough.\n\nBefore you had to bring a firebomb or find a lantern in the world to set hunters on fire. Which was fine because you had to invest ressources and time to burn a downed hunter and you had to move and take a risk because people could shoot you when you had to come close to burn a hunter.\n\nNowadays you can burn hunters with a million tools and consumables that are easy to restock and to bring and you can safely ignite hunters from behind cover with a flare pistol even from 50 meteres away. No ressources have to be invested, no risk taken. It is nowadays a surprise if you are not instantly getting set on fire even before your body has hit the ground.\n\nAnd no that is not enough they even cranked up the burn speed by far so that if your mates do not instantly save you or throw a choke bomb (which is basically useless because it got also nerfed) you are out of the game in a very short time. Often enough you are not able to get your mate back because the bounty already left the game.\n\nThe official reason for this was they wanted to break up stalemates so people are not camping around dead bodies for hours. The effect is that people are even more camping now because the risk of getting burned is so high and punishing that it further promotes the passive meta, sitting around an waiting for others to make a move to third party them. Which means more stalemates and more boring camping.\n\nAgain everyone can play as they want and if people like to camp and sit around it is absolutely their right to do so and play the game this way. But I do not enjoy this at all, that is why the current development towards this gameplay is loosing me as a player.\n\n\n- Matchmaking\n\nCrytek changed the matchmaking system so that more players are in the six star bracket (the hightest bracket is six stars, most players are around 3-5 Stars). The Skill difference between a high six star player and a low six star players feels way bigger than the difference between 3 and low 5 star. In Six star you have a lot of bush camping snipers and a few shooter gods that are just very very good at the game.\n\nSometimes you get matches with a mix of 6, 3 and 4 Star Players in a trio that have a 5 Star Rating as a team. If you read through official discord and forums you will see a lot of people screenshoting their Matchmaking Team Compositions and if you are a team of 3 stars or 4 stars, one six star can sometimes be enough to fuck up your whole lobby.\n\nThey also built in a more robust system so you do not drop in MMR as fast as you did once. Which is an issue for me because if I get on 6 stars (which happens regularly) I will get my ass handed to me for days before I finally get down to 5 Stars and find somewhat enjoyable matched with people that are on my skill level. I know from the people I play with (most of them I got to know through hunt in the recent years) have the same issue. While this is good to protect newer players from people intentionally dropping in MMR (Which was an issue before), it can also be a big pain for others.\n\nThis leads to me stopping to enjoy the game because every round becomes a sweatfest. I started to pick meta weapons and loadouts more often because using fun weapons punishes you way to much if you hit your skill ceiling. Which is a shame. Because playing the same 5 Weapons all the time really burns me out from the game.\n\n\n\n- Objectives\n\nI think a lot of people play Hunt for the PvP. The PvE Part is just a motivation for people to get in the game and fight. This leads to a lot of situations where people rather ambush people fighting the bounty team and letting the bounty escape for free to get one or two kills. While in general I think ambushing is a valid tactical move in Hunt, it really annoys me that the motivation to get the tokens are very low.  Quite often the bounty lair is right next to an extract in the corner of the map. So at least 1 or 2 teams are furthest away from the boss and if you get in a fight it is almost impossible to catch up with the bounty. Most of the extracts are designed to heavily favour the people who are trying to extract. Which itself is fine. But even if you run in to block the extract (which kills you a lot of the times you do, to buy some time for your team to catch up) people are despawning right in front of your nose even though you tried to use the quickest way possible to stop them. I think it should not be possible to have an extract exactly at the boss lair.\n\n- Major Bugs\nHunt has some reoccuring bugs that are very annoying and can ruin a good round sometimes. They are battling them more and more which I appreciate but still there are some issues.\n\n-- Explosives and Walls\nExplosives and Wall blocking in Hunt are inconsistent. Frag Bombs and frag arrows making you bleed even though you are behind a solid stone wall. Dynamites killing you through solid walls or through a massive ceiling while you are upstairs and it explodes downstairs are super annoying. I do enjoy playing explosives and I am pretty good at using explosives in Hunt if I am allowed to say so myself, but it can be very annoying to throw a dynamite at someones feet and they only get a scratch.\n\n-- Hitboxes\n\nHitboxes in hunt are pretty whacky sometimes. It could also be a mix of bad server performance/ping and weird hitboxes but the amount of arm hits and shotguns not killing well within their OHK Range is high. Even when you check replays and see the bullet enter a body or a head, the dmg chart shows you only an arm hit or a lower torso hit.\n\nI will update this post when I have time to add a bit more context and maybe some constructive criticism and idead how to resolve some of the issues. If the Game improves I will also change this accordingly.", 0.7963740229606628], ["I will be brief.

Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not a bad player; my aim is solid, and my movement isn\u2019t terrible, but the enemies we face are on another level. They don\u2019t miss a single shot. So many times, we get into a fight, and both of us get instantly wiped by one guy with two bullets\u2014one in my head, one in my teammate\u2019s. I\u2019ve never complained about stuff like this before, but what\u2019s happening in Hunt isn\u2019t normal. And most of these players have lower MMR than me! Out of 10 matches, we\u2019re lucky to extract once.\n\nWhat I don\u2019t get is how these players are this cracked but somehow only have 2 MMR stars. I wouldn\u2019t complain if this was coming from 5- or 6-star players, but 2 stars?! I\u2019ve watched YouTube videos of 5-star players, and even they aren\u2019t as insane as the enemies we face. As long as the matchmaking is this broken, I can\u2019t give the game a positive review.\n\nIn my opinion, the game should implement 2FA (phone verification) to cut down on smurfs or whatever\u2019s causing this.
