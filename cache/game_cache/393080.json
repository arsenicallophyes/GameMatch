But anyways, THIS title is without a doubt, definitely and personally one of my FAVORITE and most CHERISHED video games, of all time. (As with tens of millions of others I bet) This game in particular, I cherish very closely similar to its original. (nearly two decades ago now, in 2007) Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare in 2007 obviously and factually set a new revolutionary standard for both the FPS genre and online multiplayer industry simultaneously. Also, the notable Call of Duty titles ranging from 2005-2015, had taught me a multitude of things I went on to understand and develop decades later, and even still utilize today, to a degree. Now, I won't be nerding out any further on the MEMORABLE, and ICONIC campaign/multiplayer, as it's unfortunately redundant in this case, sorry. (As much as I'd typically love to) Fortunately, Modern Warfare: Remastered ran nearly PERFECTLY fine for me. However, I had eventually experienced a somewhat of a known bug within THIS version of the game, so I had disabled the \"shader pre-load\" option. Oh, and HEY! DON'T give your money to Activision, UNLESS the game's are on SALE, which they ALL do go on occasionally but MOSTLY periodically! (Selective holidays, Steam sales, or events, etc.) Lastly, I love this game and it breaks the tens of millions of us that we may never live the moments of playing our FAVORITE Call of Duty titles in their prime again. ANYHOW, remain vigilant when dealing with ANY older Call of Duty titles multiplayer such as this. Enjoy the campaign and timeless classic of a game, cheers! \n\n10/10 - RoniiBoi", 0.5935748219490051], ["I think this is a good remaster But i recomend turning shader preload OFF in the advanced video options i think it makes the game Crash less and the game looks Amazing note.

I used to be able to run the game just fine, but for some reason it stopped working today and will no longer start properly, even though the game was running fine just the day prior. It boggles my mind how Activision, with all their resources, can't properly optimize a game to work. A shame too, as this was one of my favorite ways to play the original Modern Warfare campaign. Hopefully this is somehow fixed soon, whether by a dedicated fan who has more time on their hands or more unlikely, Activision themselves.", 0.5277303457260132], ["The worst call of duty i ever played i couldn't complete the campaing cuz it was crashing on a fucking loading screen do not buy it is not worth it", 0.523809552192688], ["The remaster looks and feels great\u2014classic campaign, upgraded visuals, and tight gameplay.

Usually most games when they try to make graphics look \"good\" loose their personality, like how everything from modern warfare 2019 to black ops 6 looks almost the same, meanwhile when you compare the older games like modern warfare 2 to black ops 3 it looks and feels so much more different than the more recent titles, this game however manages to visually look great and not loose its personality.
