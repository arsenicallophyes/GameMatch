My issue isnt the price itself, but the reason behind it. Instead of implementing proper anti-cheat measures, the devs chose to fight cheaters by putting the game behind a paywall. Honestly, a genius move. The game was (and probably still is) in a rough state, so why fix anything when you can simply put a price tag on it? Literally free money. \n\nTo be fair, old players could still play game for free, which i appreciate.

Take those $20 and buy a better game\n\n\nUtter Horseshit, I let some kid use my account to play the game but I used to play it on quest a bunch.  The problem is they don't fox their game.  \n- The game is over run with cheaters\n           - There is no anti-cheat\n- The game is over run with babies who were given a quest because their parents are incapable of raising them\n- The devs don't fix any bugs or play test before releasing an update\n- The devs only focus on milking money from the daycare of a player base they have accumulated\n\nThese 5 things just make the game shit, the devs don't do anything and more and more little kids and cheaters play.  I liked the game for its movement but I can't even enjoy it anymore.  The quest applab is filled with Gorilla Tag knock offs due to gorilla tag's code being open sourced.  Spoiler Alert all the knock offs are half assed and poorly made.   \n\nIf you still really want to play this game you can for like a few hours or so.  Don't be surprised when you see a cheater or a squeaker screaming slurs.  God forbid you try to be the good guy and report these people and then your game will crash, you fly out of the map, or the whole lobby reports you.
