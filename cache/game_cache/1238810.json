I would, but with caveats. While the game is decent, I would encourage players to consider other titles in the [i]Battlefield[/i] series, such as [i]Battlefield 1[/i] and [i]4[/i], before settling on this one. Also, be aware that it's quite large, taking up 91.5GB of space.\n\nBefore I go into what I enjoy about this game, I want to highlight an important factor for anyone in the Oceanic region, like myself. Although finding games is possible, you will likely experience a high ping, averaging around 125. Occasionally, you might stumble upon a dedicated Oceanic server, but in my experience, these tended to pop up mainly on weekends. This is crucial to keep in mind since the game is primarily an online experience, and the quality of your connection can significantly impact your enjoyment.\n\nVisually, the game is stunning; the developers have clearly aimed for a cinematic experience in the design. However, the user interface leaves much to be desired. It\u2019s not intuitive at all, and many improvements could have been made to enhance usability. The sound design generally works well, although I found that playing without headphones made everything feel a bit quiet and off. Overall, the audio experience is decent but could be better.\n\nThe short campaigns in the game are okay \u2014 not remarkable, but they do offer some engaging narratives. I found that when playing on hardcore, the AI can be merciless with their aim, so you'll want to remain close to cover as often as possible. Nevertheless, it is entirely feasible to complete each story on the hardest difficulty.\n\nThe multiplayer component, which is the core experience of this game, can be a real mixed bag. It can be exhilarating one moment and incredibly frustrating the next for a variety of reasons. One of the main issues for me is the connectivity. As mentioned earlier, this is largely beyond anyone\u2019s control, but it does create challenges when playing with friends, especially if they live across the globe. In such situations, someone inevitably has to cope with poor connections. Another downside is the presence of cheaters and hackers, which can undoubtedly tarnish the gameplay experience. I encountered two prominent types: one that annihilated the entire lobby repeatedly, including their own team, and another that had speed and invincibility. Additionally, the limited selection of maps can lead to monotony quite quickly. In my case, it was largely due to not enjoying the maps themselves, but this is subjective and may vary for different players. \n\nFor myself, I often found my options limited to conquest modes since those were the only games I could join with a low ping; if you're located closer to Europe or America, this likely won't be an issue for you.\n\nThough I could spend time detailing various complaints about connection issues and the toxic behaviour of some players, I did manage to enjoy myself when the games were running smoothly. There's a broad array of weapons to experiment with across different classes, each offering its own unique playstyle. The vehicles are also quite fun to use [i](I\u2019m referring specifically to tanks, as I struggle with flying in these games)[/i], and like most multiplayer experiences, it's far more enjoyable when played with friends.\n\nIn conclusion, the game is a decent choice if you\u2019re looking to hop into a [i]Battlefield[/i] experience. However, if you reside far from major player bases, like I do in the Oceanic region, you might want to think twice before investing your money. While I believe the game has its merits, I would not recommend purchasing it at full price; instead, I suggest waiting for a significant sale before making a decision.\n \n[h1][b]Achievements:[/b][/h1]\nThe achievements in this game are predominantly focused on multiplayer, with a few tied to the campaign and difficulty.\n\nCampaign achievements aren\u2019t too complicated, but they do require you to complete three out of the four stories on the hardest difficulty. This can be quite challenging due to the AI's remarkable aim at this level. I highly recommend taking your time to clear each area before moving on or tackling objectives whenever possible. Stealth is your best friend here; try to engage enemies without drawing too much attention. Fortunately, since you only need to complete three stories, this makes getting the achievements a bit easier.\n\nWhen it comes to multiplayer achievements, the experience can range from straightforward to quite difficult. Most of the achievements are simple and can be completed during regular gameplay. However, one that I recommend boosting is \"Death from Above,\" which requires you to destroy five manned stationary weapons using an airplane. As someone who struggles to pilot in these games, I found boosting this achievement essential.\n\nTo boost effectively, you'll need at least four players [i](two on each side)[/i] to create and/or start a community game. Unfortunately, this game must be set to public, which means random players might join. If this happens, try to communicate your intentions to them and hope they don\u2019t grief you while you\u2019re going for the achievement. One additional issue at the moment is that the game has a bug that prevents you from saving your configurations when setting up a game, so unless you have a previously configured game, you may need to search for a suitable lobby in the browser.\n\nI recommend the map [i]Panzerstorm[/i], as it\u2019s relatively flat, making it easier to achieve the required kills from the air. However, be prepared for a bit of trial and error as it\u2019s still tough to fly.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for more guidance on this achievement, there are excellent resources available online, and I suggest checking out [i]TrueAchievements[/i] for helpful tips.\n\nAside from that one multiplayer achievement, the others are relatively easy to obtain. However, keep in mind that the majority of the achievements in this game are centred around online and multiplayer play.", 0.6031745672225952], ["Fun game. No skill based matchmaking.
