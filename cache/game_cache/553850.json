Awesome co op shooter! Tons of fun with your friends!

However, I absolutely despise ArrowHead at this point. Their entire approach to development of this game is atrocious, including the most recent update that makes it so people who bought the game a year ago can no longer play because they stealthily changed the system requirements. Despite generally enjoying this game, I cannot in good faith recommend it to new players just because of the trash way the studio has approached updates, balancing, bugs, and their overall interactions with the community as a whole.", 0.6407133340835571], ["Fantastic.

Lets wheel out this heap of buggy (no pun intended) mess that wants to choke-hold you into membership's and Kernel level anti-cheat software and then we'll kick you while you're writhing around on the floor. \n\nI will dive no more.", 0.5872780084609985], ["This has been an awesome game to 100% with my friends; the community is great and super supportive during all my interactions.\n\n9/10 game, For Super-Earth", 0.5760888457298279], ["Don't complain about the difficulty, it is easy to play on any level you want to so the top levels should be quite hard. The only possible criticism I could imagine is that some things can get a little repetitive, but all said and done I have enjoyed this game immensely, and still play it semi-regularly.

It's more of a friend kind of game if you want to really have fun on it. I only played it solo in the beginning to unlock starting weapons.

However, I just wish the devs would start focusing on fixing the game's issues.\n\nThe recent update that came with the new warbond, Borderline Justice, was executed quite poorly and introduced a number of unfavourable issues to the game, noticeably messing up the TAA graphic setting and introducing some other small but noticeable bugs that were not present pre-update.\n\nHell, the most recent patch somehow messed up the reload mechanic for a widely-used weapon. The issue was that significant that they quickly released a patch for that patch which solely fixed said issue.\n\nThis type of behaviour from the devs has become a repeating issue for a while and a lot of people are becoming frustrated with it when you notice that other issues that share the same significance, such as mission softlocks which are surprisingly common, have been in the game for a while and are still yet to be fixed or even addressed by the devs.\n\nAll in all, this game is really good but if you are on the fence with buying it then I would wait until said issues have at least been addressed.

Don't buy this game unless you've got a PC from NASA or unless the devs actually make the game run properly. Game was great fun when it was playable, but it hasn't been for months.
