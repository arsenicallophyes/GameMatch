The story was interesting with lots of kool characters, although it is a little over the top to keep fighting with the same character in the story mode. It is a continuation from the previous games. There are many new characters added to give us a wider range of options. Lots of mini games such as test your might (a thumb killer) . It can be a bit of a slugfest to earn enough koins to unlock all the skins, fatality and brutality. DLCs recommend for anyone who can't be bothered. The price is really low for such a high quality game. Rekommend when on sales.\n\nP.s.
