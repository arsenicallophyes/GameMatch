Don\u2019t believe in its other promises because it has lazy developers.\n", 0.5737583637237549], ["Bannerlord has come a long way since its rocky launch. While it still doesn\u2019t quite have that magic spark that Warband had, there\u2019s no denying that Bannerlord is now a solid game \u2014 and a worthy sequel in most respects. It\u2019s exactly what you\u2019d expect from a follow-up: more of the same, but bigger, better-looking, and far more refined.\n\nThe quality-of-life improvements alone are fantastic. Managing armies, fiefs, companions \u2014 everything feels smoother and more accessible now. The systems are still deep, but far more player-friendly than Warband ever was. Core combat is still satisfying, large-scale battles are a blast, and the game world finally feels alive thanks to all the new systems and polish.\n\nBut let\u2019s be honest \u2014 the real reason Bannerlord is starting to shine is mods. Now that the game\u2019s been out for a few years and the modding tools are solid, the community is kicking off properly. Those legendary total conversion mods from the Warband days \u2014 Lord of the Rings, Warhammer, historical eras like the Samurai and Napoleonic Wars \u2014 are all starting to take shape again.\n\nThere are already a few standout mods with active communities, like Persistent World, which is fantastic for those who want that immersive sandbox roleplay and combat. There\u2019s even a small competitive scene for vanilla and some mods, where players join teams, clans, or regiments and take part in organised battles. So whether you're into casual sandboxing, roleplay, or competitive multiplayer, there\u2019s a decent amount going on for everyone.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been on the fence about jumping in, now\u2019s a great time. The vanilla experience is solid, but as these big mods get more fleshed out, Bannerlord might just recapture that iconic spark Warband had for so many of us.\n\nAnd TaleWorlds...\nWHERE\u2019S MY NAPOLEONIC DLC?!\nWe need line battles. Muskets. Drums. Shouts of \u201cHold the line!\u201d echoing across snowy hillsides.

Unfortunately, now I choose this over that for those reasons, since big battles and trebuchets breaking walls have been something I've wanted a first/third person hand in since Total War.\n\nBut why, why do I not recommend this. Because, it's been 5 years since release, and it's just revolting how Talesworld keep adding dumb updates that break mods we rely on to add stuff to the game that the lazy developers should have added by now.\n\nThe DLC they are coming out with is so lacking in comparison to warbands DLC's. Charging us for adding naval battles and a new faction to the base game is a poor excuse for a DLC. \n>:(\n\nViking Conquest for warband, had it's own campaign, it's own full fledged map of England, Ireland and Denmark, factions to match, and new unique mechanics. Napoleanic Wars for warband also had content. These were worthy of being called DLC's, since they actually delivered on content. But no, Talesworld have got their money now didn't they, so their care level for the customers has gone down.\n\nIf warband had the same siege mechanics with breaking walls, trebuchets and what have you. and the ability for 2000 warriors in a battle, I'd be on that instead of this piece of unstable crap.", 0.5586550831794739], ["Overall, very good game play.

Battle Terrain System\r\nWorks just as intended, only problem is not all maps have been created/released. And there is snow and rain on the campaign map which doesn't really affect the outcome of battles.\r\n2. Voice Acting for Dialogues\r\nA portion of dialogues, especially greetings and main storyline conversations, have been voiced in English. Doesn't really add much, it's a nice touch and all but basically no localization and feels weird when the silent dialogue was just fine.\r\n3. Multiplayer Enhancements\r\nFeatures like voice chat, cheer and shout systems, and custom servers have been introduced to improve multiplayer communication and gameplay. And on top of that, they broke the sounds for the cheers with the new implementation of extra cheers you can unlock with in-game currency.\r\n4. Crafting Orders\r\nThis system allows players to accept crafting orders, adding depth to the weapon crafting system and providing a new career path within the sandbox.\r\n5. Keep Battles\r\nExpanded sieges now include climactic battles within besieged castles, offering more immersive siege experiences.\r\n6. Party and Kingdom War Stances\r\nPlayers can assign orders to subordinate parties to dictate their approach towards hostilities, adding strategic depth to kingdom management. Though I haven't noticed any big difference in AI responsiveness to this.\r\n7. Perks\r\nYou can customize your characters based on what perks you put on them, some perks do not work and there is no way of training the perks other than doing their passive skill ( no books or trainers)\r\n\r\nUnimplemented or Uncertain Features\r\n1. Expanded Settlement Management\r\nWhile the game includes basic settlement management, more detailed control over village infrastructure and development is still lacking.\r\n2. Replay Editor\r\nAlthough there were discussions about a replay feature, it has not been fully realized or integrated into the game.\r\n3. Unique Companion Quests\r\nThe game lacks unique quests for companions, which were initially promised to add depth to character interactions. This one has received the cold shoulder when asked about to silently get rid of any further ideas of implementing it.\r\n4. Expanded Banditry and Crime Systems\r\nPromised features like expanded interactions with city gangs and a more complex crime system have not been fully implemented.\r\n5. Intrigue and Diplomacy\r\nMechanics involving espionage, defamation, and complex diplomatic interactions are still underdeveloped or missing.\r\n6. Feasts, Tournaments, and Ceremonies\r\nSocial events like feasts, tournaments, and ceremonies for milestones such as a child's coming-of-age are not present in the game. Tournaments are just random events that appear and sometimes hold no meaningful reward or participants.\r\n\r\nIn Development or Under Consideration\r\n1. Sally Out Missions\r\nCurrently, when defenders sally out during a siege, it initiates a standard field battle. Plans are in place to create dedicated missions for these events to enhance immersion. \u200b\r\n2. Cut Scenes for Life Events\r\nThe introduction of cut scenes to commemorate significant life events, such as the birth of a child or the death of a comrade, is planned to improve narrative immersion.\r\n\r\nThese are not everything that was promised, but just some key points to give somewhat of an idea of what's happening with the game. Could go on with minor bugs in singleplayer and multiplayer combat bugs and animation glitches, but main part of all of this is to say that the game was never fully released. I'm not saying I didn't have fun spending 1000 hours in singleplayer and another 1000 in multiplayer, just saying what they're putting out is not what you're getting, as I have seen plenty of people with no more than 10 hours just quit the game because it's not what has been advertised. So this upcoming DLC is just another cash grab from Taleworlds, same strategy they pulled when they classified the game as fully released and releasing the weird digital companion DLC, same as when they released it for consoles and you can't even download mods ( unsure if you can even play multiplayer on console). I like the game but if you're expecting everything you've read or seen on Taleworlds promotion don't bother buying.", 0.5444685220718384], ["Dead world when all is said and done.

When your second wave randomly spawns, you're not alerted, so they may end up just standing there not doing anything. \n\n- you can organize the order of your soldier types in your party manager, but if all of a certain kind dies or are upgraded, but then you get more of that kind later, they'll appear at the bottom of the list instead of in the spot you put them in, making the sorting function essentially pointless when you have to completely redo it after every major battle and re-recruiting cycle.\n\n- friendly armies have very poor AI and will do things like walk right by smaller and weaker enemy armies that are besieging your towns and castles or aimlessly chase around smaller but faster enemy parties they'll never catch up with until the army is forced to disband after running out of the cohesion stat.\n\n- if you get captured you're stuck with no options but to watch the NPC who captured you randomly run around the map till it finally offers you to pay a ransom to be freed, and when you do, you have a temporary speed penalty and will often get recaptured again within seconds.\n\nIt's a broken, half-finished game.
