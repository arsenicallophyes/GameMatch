I gave the game a watch on yt, then played the mod, then standalone a bit and so on. I took a massive break from the game, mostly because, life, career, kids, etc. I don't remember what update it was when I came back to the game, but I believe it was around 1.23. \n\nThere is no real reason why it shouldn't be an abject failure. There is no real story or purpose, It is unfair, it doesn't respect your time, it will not tell you anything. You will die over and over and when you finally get past zombies, starvation, dehydration, sickness, you will be shot in the back, at a well, as a freshie, for literally no reason. But there is nothing else like it.  \n\nI've had more adventures and experienced more unforgettable stories than any other game I have played. It has made me literally sweat, shake, yell and randomly\u2026 made me much better at navigation on irl hikes.\n\nIts a lot like hunting, you mostly do nothing, looking at nature for hours and hours and hours, stopping because you thought you heard a sound\u2026 then, out of nowhere, for 5 - 10 minutes you experience all emotions, all at once, in rapid succession and you're hooked. \n\nMoral of the story, Its good, Sakhal is good, 1.26 and 1.27 have been phenomenal updates, cheating on official isn't as bad as some people like to make it out to be. The community by and large is very good, the community servers are as well. There are tons of streamers/yt\u2019s making enjoyable content, if you like to watch what you play. And the modding community/map designers are incredible and we are lucky to have them in addition to the Dev team at BI. \n\nget it and get a mic\n", 0.8621371388435364], ["rage cheaters galore , literally makes game unplayable. you cant even bury your stash with out someone using esp to dig it up. my favorite is when people tp your base in the air or put my cars on roofs. youll be minding your business inside a secured building and boom dead. these people love magic bullet", 0.752021849155426], ["Here is the thing... this game is amazing, can't believe it took me this many years to find it. However, their servers are horrible. If want to enjoy an amazing game and then aggravate the crap out of yourself.

I can't even click on one because it's loading thousands of servers at once so it's always scrolling. I can't sort by type I can only search words. When I search a keyword it will SOMETIMES give a result, but sometimes I have to search several times before the server my friend saw shows up for me. Then when I try to join it the game tells me I don't have the required mods. I started the game with the option for no mods, so the game knows I have no mods, why am I seeing thousands of servers that I can't join? When I finally found a server I can join the game crashed.

Certainly not without its flaws, but ultimately with how big the maps are and how detailed the game is its extremely impressive.

While the zombies seem to be the catalyst for the fall of humanity I do not feel like they are what one should be worried about. They are  hungry and they will eat you. However, it is in multiplayer online that the real enemy is found. It is your neighbor, your friend, your, your mom your woman your children  Family and friends can still leave a man hungry and wanting. So yeah it is a survival zombie game but the other humans you are playing with are more likely to kill you and take your stuff.
