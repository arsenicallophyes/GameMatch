Specifically, the experience of being repeatedly and unapologetically bullied by medieval architecture, undead warriors, and the very concept of hope.\n\nYou don\u2019t play Dark Souls. You survive it. Barely. Then you die. Then you survive a bit more. Then you roll off a cliff because your fat-fingered dodge was two pixels off. Classic.\n\nThe story? Oh, it's there. Somewhere. Probably scribbled on a wall behind a hidden wall behind another hidden wall guarded by a depressed dragon. Every NPC speaks in riddles, metaphors, or what sounds like Shakespeare having an existential breakdown. Meanwhile, you\u2019re standing there in a rusty bucket-helmet, covered in regret and moss.\n\nCombat is tight, rewarding, and feels great \u2014 for the five seconds before a 12-foot skeleton dropkicks you into the sun. Boss fights are majestic duels where you die in 0.3 seconds, whisper \u201cokay, fair,\u201d and queue up to die again.\n\nAnd let\u2019s talk about mimics. Remember how other games reward curiosity? Not here. In Dark Souls, opening the wrong chest gets you eaten alive by a demonic tongue monster. Trust no one. Especially furniture.\n\nThe game\u2019s world design is stunning in a \u201clook how beautiful this place is, shame it wants me dead\u201d sort of way. You\u2019ll traverse haunted castles, poison swamps, and hell dimensions\u2026 all while questioning your life choices and the sanity of the developers.\n\nFinal Verdict: 9/10\nLost one point because I screamed at a goat demon so loud my neighbor asked if I was okay. I wasn't. I\u2019m still not.\n\nRecommended for people who think \u201cfun\u201d is overrated and want to feel something. Anything.\n\nP.S. If it looks like a chest\u2026 hit it first.

I love this game way more than Elden Ring. Sure, it was my first Soulsborne game, but this is so different, in a better way. The graphics take you to a wonderful world with beautiful landscapes and some that cause your PC to explode. The bosses were amazing in the first half, but did die down second half. I loved the grind that was way harder than Elden Ring, this felt like a real challenge. With 100% now, I move on to other games, but man, this was an amazing game. I highly recommend people who loved Elden Ring or just hard games to try it, and as a little challenge, try and not summon, trust me it's way funner.

Out of all the souls games this would be considered the \"easiest\" even though the game itself isn't. It's a game that doesn't baby you around and forces you to learn and overcome hurdles that by the end you would be better as a gamer overall. The satisfaction you get for either killing a boss or getting an achievement is euphoric and not many games can achieve that feeling. It's fun, it's hard, it's a masterpiece of it's time and while it's age really shows nowadays, it doesn't really retract from the whole experience.

Good QoL additions, but some of the minor art changes rubbed me the wrong way. If Prepare to Die Edition is a 10/10, this one is a 9.9/10.", 0.523809552192688], ["Setting and Atmosphere\nDark Souls is set in the haunting and decaying kingdom of Lordran, a place where the age of fire is fading, and the undead curse has gripped humanity. The world of Lordran is intricately designed, with areas interconnected through clever shortcuts that create a sense of discovery and immersion. The seamless world design is arguably one of the game\u2019s greatest achievements, giving players the feeling of exploring a massive, living labyrinth. The atmosphere is thick with a sense of despair and decay, emphasized by minimalistic ambient music that only swells during boss fights, making those encounters feel epic and intense.\n\nStory and Lore\nThe story is subtle and deeply layered, told through item descriptions, environmental storytelling, and cryptic dialogues from NPCs. You play as the Chosen Undead, destined to link the fire and prolong the Age of Fire or let it fade into the Age of Dark. The game never holds your hand in telling this story, leaving much of it to interpretation. The rich lore, crafted by Hidetaka Miyazaki, creates a sense of myth and tragedy that resonates long after you put down the controller.\n\nGameplay and Combat\nThe combat in Dark Souls is precise, methodical, and punishing. Every encounter feels like a duel, requiring patience, timing, and skill. The game\u2019s signature stamina management system forces you to balance attacking, blocking, and dodging carefully. Weapon variety is impressive, from mighty greatswords to agile rapiers, and every weapon has a unique move set that encourages experimentation. The parry and riposte mechanics are particularly satisfying, rewarding skilled players with devastating counter-attacks.\n\nOne of the most iconic aspects of Dark Souls is its boss design. From the imposing Bell Gargoyles to the chilling Four Kings, each boss presents a unique challenge, often testing your reflexes, strategy, and understanding of the game\u2019s mechanics. Bosses like Ornstein and Smough stand out as some of the best in the series, demanding a mastery of both movement and combat flow.\n\nCharacter Customization and Builds\nCustomization is extensive, allowing players to tailor their character to their preferred playstyle. You can build a dexterous swordsman, a hulking tank, a powerful sorcerer, or a versatile hybrid. The stat system is complex, rewarding thoughtful distribution to maximize damage and survivability. Magic builds feel drastically different from melee builds, offering a wide array of spells, miracles, and pyromancies that add replayability.\n\nLevel Design\nThe interconnected world design is a masterpiece in itself. Unlocking shortcuts feels like a revelation, and the way levels loop back on themselves is nothing short of genius. Areas like Anor Londo, Blighttown, and Sen\u2019s Fortress each offer unique challenges and aesthetics that make exploration both daunting and exhilarating.\n\nMultiplayer and PvP\nThe multiplayer component, including co-op and PvP invasions, is seamlessly integrated into the world. Summoning players for assistance or invading other worlds to challenge them adds unpredictability and excitement to the experience. The covenant system also provides incentives for different multiplayer playstyles, from helping other players to hunting them down.", 0.523809552192688], ["yea sure why wouldn't i recommend the greatest [u] euphemism [/u] of my life xD\r\nbashing your head at something repetitiously for someone else's gain? yea its like having a dead end office job only cooler cause its not an office and there's [b] fucking dragons [/b]", 0.5220588445663452], ["The recent 'Seamless Co-op' mod by Yui on NexusMods is absolutely incredible.

It's probably just nostalgia talking, but I love almost every aspect of this game. The music is killer. The map and world design still blows my mind to this day with its creative inter-connectivity. The combat is challenging, but rewarding and rarely feels unfair. Boss fights (for the most part *cough Capra Demon and Bed of Chaos cough*) are incredibly fun and memorable. And despite its age, the graphics are pretty solid. \n\nMy favorite aspect of this game, however, might be the lore. Your first play through, you will probably miss a majority of the story due to being overwhelmed by the harsh environment, or because a large portion of it is hidden away. Once you overcome this, you will find that there is some unique, artistic storytelling and world building that brings significant context to your journey through Lordran. The community also has amazing people who have helped bring these hidden story aspects to the mainstream. \n\nWhile DS3 and Elden Ring are both amazing games in their own right, I always find myself looking back fondly at this influential game. It made me fall in love with the Souls genre and the sense of accomplishment that is felt when you finally overcome a challenge you have been stuck on for hours. The feelings I have when playing this game are unmatched.
