Id even say it might feel like a turned-based action game, where both you and the monster take your respective turns to punish eachother.\nThankfully, its not a game where you button-mash your way to victory, especially in later fights, you HAVE TO learn monster's moveset and especially your weapon's moveset, otherwise you either fail by carting or just time-out. And it feels great to learn that stuff and improve as a player. And there is alot to learn for each of 14 available weapons, that even after hundred of hours you still might learn new things even about a single weapon you main.\nYou dont get better in the game just by getting better gear or leveling up your stats, you get better in the game by learning its mechanics.\n\nThe monsters design is overall great, especially in Iceborne and its TUs. While there are some outliers, it doesnt take away from the greats like Velkhana, Namielle, Alatreon, Fatalis, Rajangs, Odogarons, Anjanaths, Zinogres and so on and so forth. Id say over half of the roster is great, the other half is either good or good enough. And then there are few like Lavasioths, Zorah and other Leshens, which Id say are just not fun to fight, thankfully you dont have to do most of them multiple times.\nThis is probably the only game where you can kill monster 100s of times and everytime it still feels fun to engage with it.\nI would've never thought that even grind for Decos and Materials might be so fun for hundreds of hours either just by doing Guiding Lands and slaying everything in sight or killing Tempered Teostra 300 times.\n\nDepsite it being a 7 y.o game, it still looks great even now, even in comparison to the 6th gen. And runs great even on mid hardware.\n\nThe only negative thing I can say about the game is probably story, but it doesnt take that much time to finish it, and you still get to experience alot of great monsters in there.\n\nIt might be hard to get into, especially if you havent played a game like that before, but its a rewarding experience for sure. You can always try and read in-game tutorials which give you some basic info or just look some more in-depth ones on platforms like YT.\n", 0.6036804914474487], ["This games dlc adds more than two times the content of the main game and both the main game and the dlc is peak", 0.547325074672699], ["Monster Hunter: World lets you live out your fantasy of becoming a glamorous beast slayer, just be prepared to spend hours grinding for that one rare scale and carting (dying) more times than you'd like to admit.

I booted this game back up today and just was taken back by the maps, the colors, the music, etc. It's a little slow going at first but once it gets going, it's hard to stop playing. I booted up wilds after playing and opened up the maps, looked at the boring roster and shut it back down. I think when I want a MH fix, I'll play this. I also enjoy rise, but can't seem to find people who play it at a lower rank. If there was I'd play that as well.

The ecology and monster behavior in this game is HONESTLY incredible to me, as someone who's a nerd about biology, and it's a shame to see proceeding games not have the same effort put into this area. I'm conflicted on the fact that this game begins the \"new\" style of monster hunter, but I think it's fine enough in this game and streamlines enough to be nice but not so much as to trivialize crucial parts of the monster hunter formula (cough cough, wilds). All being said, maybe get a shader overhaul because EVERYTHING in this game is blue, unnatural, washed out lighting, and it's extremely offputting to me personally.
