I did play it quite a bit in the past, because my friends always wanted to play it, so I joined in, but it was bad.\n\nThe way the weapons felt wasn't good, the battle royale format still was in its early days and didn't really feel polished. The dropsystem was weak... I also think the genre just isn't my favorite to begin with.\n\nThe map felt pretty empty and you die very quickly against good players. The difference is incredibly. Might aswell not even get equip, as they'll be able to get you before you even see anyone.\n\nI also think the game is pretty much dead nowadays, ah well, at least it is free.", 0.5767059922218323], ["Fuck this game & its 3rd party launcher + login.\nSome chinese fker hacked it & got me banned years ago & Now i got a permanent stain on my account", 0.5], ["Man I wish I could go back to before the game split.... :(", 0.5930949449539185], ["They kill the game so hard...\nBring me back to H1Z1!", 0.5], ["Good Game.
