And honestly, it's because I am scared, scared of the threat of them making another lifeless, dull and overall awful game dragging a once great franchise with amazing characters through the mud just so they can make some quick money off of the faith that maybe this time they won't mess it up, rather than sending Halo out with a bang they just kept poking the lifeless corpse with a stick to get a few extra bucks out of it.\n\nLastly to the publishers and developers of this massive disappointment (not that you'll ever read something written by a member of your community) I hope none of you worked on the prior titles that were loved so much by your community because if you did you really fell from grace and I think a long look at what you created and how you fell so far is needed, do us all a favour add halo 5 to MCC and leave Halo alone.", 0.8179926872253418], ["glitch in multiplayer that resets your controller settings. 343 never make another halo game ever again please, oh wait you guys dont even make your games, you just outsource the work , and rely on players to make maps in forge. disgrace", 0.7300381064414978], ["So you made a playable game, and then you just broke it?

Tried the online fixes but it never worked.\r\nWasted my money on it because even when you can play, the multiplayer is kind of garbage and is nothing like the original halo games. Dont even get me started on the dog water campaign thats just a huge map with copy pasted assests all over the place. Doesnt have any of the \"sparkle\" that the old halos did. Its just a microtransaction pit now.", 0.5454545617103577], ["An issue persists on pc that they have known about for years. while the gameplay is great, the fact that you sometimes just cant get it to work due to some sign in issue that they just never fixed is just sad.", 0.5454545617103577], ["Multiplayer is mid.

Absolute slap in the face to Halo fans. Its like the show where the producer boasts that he hasn't played the games and won't be tainted by the source material. I cried my eyes out in sorrow. Then this game was announced. At first I was excited. The net-gen renders of Master Chief (may he rest in peace) and I dared to hope again just to have them smashed to bits by this games poorly made unrelated undermining story along with gameplay that didn't really feel like halo. It feels like these people don't want to work here are stuck with the short straw. On no have to go work in the halo coal mines for another month. So its fair to say I am disappointed. The problem isn't just that Halo Infinite is a bad Game. The problem is that halo games were incredible and pushed the limits. This only thing this game pushes is people away from the series. I wish that the Halo studios re-brand would fix things but I wager it will only make things worse. I hope I am wrong. Look Halo Studios, if you are listening still, you'll need to review closely the first five halo games and try to recreate that feeling.", 0.5287907719612122], ["I legit cant load the game anymore, loading screen freezes and i let it run for about 1 hour", 0.5272993445396423], ["343 refuses to listen to community. who cares about new skins where is the new vehicles, new boss fights. give the players more freedom with modding on steam workshop. also do ya'll make your vehicles outta cheap plastic cause it feels like it", 0.523809552192688], ["Can no longer access game.
