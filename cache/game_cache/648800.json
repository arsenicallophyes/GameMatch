You dive for rocks and bits of metal, and use crafting stations to craft better materials to craft better items.\n\nThe problem with that statement?  The first three words: On Peaceful Mode.\n\nWhen you're [i]not[/i] on peaceful mode, one thing gets shoved into the game that ruins everything.\n\nThat [strike]Feep[/strike]ing Shark.  Those three words (the one censored you can guess) are capitalized in my mind.  From the very beginning, it's [i]there[/i], just swimming in circles around your raft.  Every now and again, That [strike]Feep[/strike]ing Shark will decide for no reason to tear off part of your raft.  It won't take long before you can make a weapon to drive That [strike]Feep[/strike]ing Shark away, but it doesn't damage it much.  After driving it away enough, though, you will eventually [i]kill[/i] That [strike]Feep[/strike]ing Shark.\n\nAnd then it'll come right back.  No real break.  Just one dead That [strike]Feep[/strike]ing Shark replaced by another That [strike]Feep[/strike]ing Shark.\n\nWhile you're on your raft, this is a constant annoyance, but nothing critical.  Even if it tears off part of your raft, it's cheap to rebuild.  It becomes infuriating, however, once you start diving for heavier elements.  Drop in the water, and here comes That [strike]Feep[/strike]ing Shark to attack.  Throw out a bait to keep it away?  You have [i]very[/i] little time for it to be occupied, and then here comes That [strike]Feep[/strike]ing Shark to attack.  Use a shark bait to bait it in and kill it?  In no time at all, here's [i]another[/i] That [strike]Feep[/strike]ing Shark attacking you.\n\nSo.  Yeah.  On normal mode?  This game is [i]not[/i] worth playing.  It's anywhere from aggravating to outright throw-the-controller-and-scream inducing.  \n\nOn Peaceful?  That [strike]Feep[/strike]ing Shark leaves you alone, and you end up with a chill experience.  There are some balance issues, in that with a little effort you can build nets to catch flotsam and have more of the basic resources than you need without any real effort, but it's a decent survival crafter with a new twist.  Not [i]great[/i], not the next new thing, but worth spending some time on.\n\nJust avoid That [strike]Feep[/strike]ing Shark.", 0.5378151535987854], ["i find this game quite challenging, although it is quite hard to progress throughout the game. i would recommend this game to people with friends who have steam else it is quite boring with no public lobbies", 0.523809552192688], ["First half an hour or so is fun, but after the first tower this game seems to be undecided on what it wants to be, story driven, survival, crafting, puzzle, parkour... it tried to be all of these things to different extents and sadly it fails to do any of these things well.\n\nCompounded with the frustrating mechanics and poor design choices that make no sense, this game just became tedious to play by the end of our play though and we were glad to see the back of it.\n\nPersonally, I cannot recommend this game.", 0.5215105414390564], ["This game was great for the most part.  Had all the things I love about this genre.  Crafting, survival calm atmosphere and exploration.  Then they went and ruined it by putting stupid boss fights at the very end.  I tried to get by this part for a few hours then quit and uninstalled the game.  I cannot imagine why they decided to add this tiresome and frustrating trope to what was previously  a masterpiece of a game.  I like this genre of game because they do not contain boss fights that impede the progression of the plot.  Planet Crafter - no boss fights, Subnautica - no boss fights (leviathan type encounters but they could be avoided and did not impede your progression in the game), Astrometica - no boss fights, No Man's Sky - no boss fights.  Added to the annoyance of the boss fight itself is the constantly respawning hyena enemies and an imprecise control scheme that was clearly not designed for intense combat sequences. Based on this section of the game which ground my enjoyment of Raft to a halt I cannot recommend the game.  It feels as though my entire experience and progression in the game was tossed out the window by the devs deciding to make into a genre I hate - platformer with boss fight.  Add to this the game's annoying behaviour of autosaving your game state into your sole single save slot when you die (after you die so that you respawn with the consequences of having died even if you reload your save).  I could have overlooked the minor annoyances but the progression halting boss crap at the end ruined it all for me.

I didn't bother with the story at first, I was too busy trying to stay alive! Now that I've established the how to's I'm starting to move along nicely. It's a fun game with lots of crafting involved. The graphics are good and the controls are easy enough with some practice. It can be very cozy on your raft when the sea is calm and the moon light is shining. Then there are huge swells and you're getting swallowed by them!
