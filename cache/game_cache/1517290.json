Set in a near-future world on the brink of collapse, it aims to deliver a high-stakes, large-scale first-person shooter experience. Marketed as a return to form after the disappointment of Battlefield V, it instead fell short of expectations - arguably becoming an even bigger misstep for the series.\n[b]As much as I\u2019ve enjoyed the game since Season 5, I still can\u2019t recommend it.[/b] Sure, the updates have been solid - DICE fixed, reworked, and added a lot of content - but it shouldn\u2019t have taken so many months to get here. \nThe game launched in a terrible state, comparable to the rocky premieres of Cyberpunk 2077 and Fallout 76. And even now, it still falls short in many areas when stacked against previous Battlefield titles. I do appreciate DICE\u2019s commitment to improving the game - especially when you consider how quickly Battlefield V was abandoned - but it\u2019s simply not enough. [b]DICE and EA: if you want players to leave positive reviews, try launching a GOOD and FINISHED product next time.[/b]\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nDisappointingly, there's no campaign mode at all.\n\n[b]Game Modes[/b]\nConquest (64 and 128), Close Quarter Conquest (64), and Breakthrough (64) are really the only default game modes that matter. I personally play almost exclusively in CQC - it\u2019s intense and fast-paced - but unfortunately, the map pool is limited to just three. If you're looking for more variety, larger maps, or vehicle gameplay, Conquest and Breakthrough still hold up well. No complaints from me on that front.\nOccasionally, the game introduces special events with unique modes and rewards. While they can be hit or miss, they offer players a welcome change of pace and something fresh to experience.\n\n[b]Portal[/b]\nBattlefield Portal is an incredible concept that ultimately suffered from a lack of new content. It lets players create custom matches with a wide range of gameplay options and share them with the community. Overall, it's a fantastic feature that deserves to be a staple in future Battlefield games.\n\n[b]Hazard Zone[/b]\nHazard Zone is essentially an extraction shooter, aiming to be a Tarkov-lite set in the Battlefield universe. Unfortunately, it failed to capture interest, and as a result, it faded away quickly.\n\n[b]Specialists[/b]\nI\u2019m one of those players who couldn\u2019t care less about the specialists. Do I think it was a bad idea that doesn\u2019t fit the Battlefield formula? Absolutely. Does it make the game unplayable or even significantly less enjoyable? Not really.\nOn one hand, I like the idea of gadgets and unique traits for each operator, but on the other hand, it's a bit odd to see 20 Sundances in a single match. With a few adjustments, it could be a fun gimmick in future Battlefield games - just don't make it the core focus.\n\n[b]Gunplay[/b]\nGunplay is always subjective, so I won\u2019t spend too much time on it. Personally, I enjoyed it. It\u2019s casual and doesn\u2019t demand much mental effort - perfect for players who don\u2019t have the time to master every nuance of the game. Most of the weapons are easy to handle, meaning even with average aim, you can still find yourself topping the leaderboards.\nThe TTK (time to kill) feels solid overall - fast enough to be satisfying, with the exception of three or four guns. As a result, enemies rarely feel like bullet sponges. That said, there are still issues with hit registration, lag spikes, and occasional desyncs. These problems can make the TTD (time to death) feel frustrating at times, as you can be one-shotted without any chance to fight back. While these issues aren\u2019t as prevalent on smaller maps, they become much more noticeable in matches with 128 players.\n\n[b]Vehicles[/b]\nI don\u2019t have much to say about the vehicles in BF2042, since I rarely use them. The controls feel clunky, the vehicles move awkwardly, and flying helicopters and jets isn\u2019t all that satisfying.\n\n[b]Server Browser[/b]\nThere\u2019s no server browser, and it\u2019s hard to understand why DICE was so determined not to include it. It remains one of the dumbest decisions they made.\n\n[b]Destruction[/b]\nCompared to older Battlefield games, this one feels like a step backward. Rather than enhancing the existing systems to allow for more impactful destruction, they scaled it back. Even visually, the explosions and building demolitions lack the satisfying impact we\u2019ve come to expect.\n\n[b]Maps[/b]\nThe maps in Battlefield 2042 are a real mixed bag - some, like Spearhead, are solid, while others, like Kaleidoscope, miss the mark. The release maps were especially bad before their reworks. They were too large, too open, with vast flat terrains and hardly any cover. Thankfully, most of them are now at least playable.\nIt might be controversial (or maybe not?), but I genuinely think the later maps from the new seasons are fantastic. Redacted especially stands out - it's easily one of my all-time favorites in the Battlefield franchise.\n\n[b]HUD & UI[/b]\nI like the overall design of the HUD. It\u2019s modern, minimalist, and provides all the essential information without cluttering the screen (for the most part). Unfortunately, the customization options are limited, so if you\u2019re not a fan of the default HUD, you're pretty much stuck with it.\nAfter several patches, the UI has become much more solid. The menus have been streamlined, and even something as simple as changing attachments is no longer a hassle.\n\n[b]Visuals[/b]\nIn my opinion, the game looks (mostly) good. While the older maps could use some improvement - often feeling too clean and lacking in detail - the newer ones are visually stunning. Redacted is packed with incredible detail, while Exposure impresses with its breathtaking environmental design.\nThe dynamic weather is an impressive concept, but in the long run, it doesn\u2019t quite deliver. While random tornadoes or sandstorms can add unpredictability to fights, they often don\u2019t feel impactful enough. It would be better if these events were rarer but capable of causing real havoc on the battlefield.\n\n[b]Audio[/b]\nTechnically, the soundtrack isn't bad. It's solid electronic music with a subtle noise element. The problem, however, is that it doesn't suit the game. While it fits the theme, it doesn\u2019t match the gameplay. What we need is something that hypes us up, something to pump adrenaline into our veins! This is an FPS, not a horror or sci-fi game.\nThe rest of the audio is decent. Nothing groundbreaking, but at least everything sounds as it should.\n\n[b]Technicalities[/b]\nPerformance heavily depends on the map and game mode you're playing. From my experience, fewer players usually means better FPS and less desync. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve always avoided the 128-player mode - it\u2019s essentially a technical nightmare. Interestingly, newer maps seem to be better optimized compared to the older or reworked ones.\nThere are still a fair number of bugs and glitches. Aside from major issues like wonky hit registration and lag spikes, there are also smaller problems - like falling under the map or encountering flying vehicles.\nThe game supports crossplay with consoles, but if you're not a fan, there's an option to disable it.\n", 0.5355535745620728], ["My game constantly lags even on low settings.

Even when people try the game out on sale they never stick around and there's a reason for that. \n\nThe maps are too big and open, So you either never see anyone or you encounter 10 people at once and instantly die. It ends up just being a walking simulator at times and you get frustrated and bored. You end up spending the majoirty of the match just running from point A to point B and from point A to B there's like a million different ways you'll get instantly killed, It could be people waiting for you. It could be a random helicopter or jet. It just gets too annoying. \n\nThere is too much visual noise and clutter in this game making it almost impossible to spot enemies.

I went in with such low expectations and i was still let down.\n\nIt's beyond frustrating to lose about 80% of your fights with another player because they have better weapons and attachments than you.

There is something going on behind the scenes. \n\nThe game is just flatout unfair to new players and i refuse to slog through tons of levels just to unlock basic items that will put me on an even playing field with other players. \n\nIn no place in reality should a player lose a fire fight if they got the drop first and started firing into someones back.
