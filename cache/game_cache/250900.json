Every Run is different and Binding of Isaac never fails to suprise and challenge me. In addition to that you can really see the developers have put their heart in this game and created a really fun game. \r\nWith Friends this game is even more enjoyable.\r\n\r\nAll in all do yourself a favor and go beat Mommy!\r\n\r\n10/10\r\n\r\n\r\n", 0.6283783912658691], ["isaac has been a part of me for every chapter of my life. i always come back to it or more precisely, it always comes back to me. at my lowest and at my highest, isaac has been the backbone of my being. im afraid without it, i wouldnt have been able to type this right now. really thankful for edmund and the team for bringing us this gem of a game. isaac has been the perfect stand in for me, as of typing this right now im in the rebirth journey of my life. and hopefully just like isaac, i can find peace with myself and have the strength to shape my story just like in repentance.", 0.6118951439857483], ["Bro this is the best game if you have a toaster PC, nah but for real they don't actually make games like this anymore like what the hell, it's so simple let so addicting this game has been around for years and to this day it still gets supported that's insane nowadays games are one hit wonders they come out, shine for a year and just die off completely, similar to today's music, i highly recommend this game to anyone that wants to feel the 2000s style again, this game is a pure example of not judging a book by it's cover, don't get fooled by the graphics, yes it looks dated but who the heck cares the graphics don't make the game it's the mechanics of the game the pure skeleton that makes the game, love it.", 0.5454545617103577], ["Game good \ninsane replay value and just one of my personal favorite games since i first found it when afterbirth + came out", 0.5454545617103577], ["The Binding of Isaac is a really deep game when it comes to item synergies and what feels like millions of possible builds. Each item you pick up has the potential to change the way you play, like one might replace your regular tears with lazers or one makes you throw up big green explosive bombs, that do very high damage, but can also damage you, giving you a high risk, high reward play style. With around 700 different types of items to pick up and use, it offers a lot of variety to play with. \n\nAnd the game offers many different types of characters to play as, all with a unique and distinct play styles. One might be all about getting hit on purpose to build up damage for the remaining floor you are in while one is the complete opposite, and only gives you one hit before you go down, with the upside of flight and tears that can travel through rocks and obstacles, as well as an unique dice item, giving you a potential re roll of the item you might not wanna take, with the downside of it sometimes deleting the item. Its like gambling in a way, you will do that a lot in the game. Take risks that pay off, but also might backfire on you\n\nWhat i also like is the way achivements are tied to actual useful things. Each achivement you gain actually unlocks something new for you to find, like a new character, new floors, new paths to take and most importantly, new item unlocks. The achivement system is a good way to keep track off, what you might need to unlock next. \n\nThe one small negative i have to give is the game its the type of game you need a friend or a youtube guide to understand what to even do to unlock certain bosses or items. Its very cryptic and confusing if you dont understand it, but once you know, its easy to hop into the game and plan ahead where you want to go in your run, which boss you are working towards and so on.\n\nOverall a highly recommended game, if you still are unsure if you like it, buy the regular game game Rebirth without the dlc, try it out and if you like it, buy all the dlc. (small warning, you might have problems with converting the save from the rebirth to newest repentance + DLC, so if you want to avoid it, you could also just buy everything all at once. Its worth it and you get 200+ hours out of it)\n\n\n\n", 0.5454545617103577], ["10/10\r\nWould get just Rebirth then get DLC's when you like it and REP+ is free and does QoL changes and Co-op", 0.54356849193573], ["Ended up buying this game for myself after buying the first Binding of Issac and Rebirth for my partner as these were some of his favorite games. He ended up getting me interested in these games as well and I bought this one and all dlc so I could play online and its honestly been fun with repentance plus! Would recommend for just base game alone as you can do local multiplayer and have fun that way (though it is different without dlc), but dlc is constantly being fixed and updated along with repentance plus. Nothing is ever really the same between runs and as you play more, you get more characters you can unlock to change up the gameplay that much more and even cool challenges you can try by yourself or with friends. Be warned there's still issues with lag on online lobbies with repentance plus, but it is constantly getting better in my experiences so far.", 0.523809552192688], ["My name is Edmund\nI made the Isaac\nIt was difficult to put the items together\nBut unfortunately something went so wrong\nAnd now i cant do anything but sing this stupid song\nMy name is Edmund Edmund Edmund Edmund", 0.523809552192688], ["tons of replay value and each run is around 30-40 minutes so its a pretty fire way to pass the time when you're busy but got a little time to burn 9/10", 0.523809552192688], ["This is the best game I've ever played, saying that while writing a negative review is ironic I know however there is a problem that just happened to me halfway through my save file.

The animations and everything about the game are just fine! fun to look at even. There were however some mechanics to the game that I just didn't enjoy. The turds were too tough. The 'upgrades' were not very substantial sometimes. And acquiring a build was entirely left to RNG. I 'beat the game' after a matter of 3 hours but that was only because I got a couple of ridiculously strong upgrades that just happened to synergize.  The lack of a choice make the only way to play just blasting through as fast as you can to acquire some kind of wild build that actually works and dying about 50 times before each good run. Again, a decent entry into the genre and fun artwork but I prefer a game that has more strategy and choice involved in my runs.

No matter how many times I try, I just cannot get into it. The items seem to be luck-based more than anything; and I understand there are ways to take advantage of the tarot cards/dice in order to reroll and stuff, but that aspect just isn't fun to me. Most of the game's mechanics require the Wiki, and even then, there are too many secrets that you would have no knowledge of without watching a Youtube video or reading up somewhere.
