They should have focused only on Hogwarts, Hogsmead and the Forbidden Forest\n- you find every 5 minutes new clothes, they feel not rewards\n- NPC have stiff faces no emotions\n- No Quidditch games are in the game to participate in.\n- No real school class mechanic like in the Bully game to balance attending classes and learning spells and balance it out to find out a typical Hogwarts school year mystery\nI can only recommend this game at a deep sale.

Never read the books, barely watched the movies. That said, I was genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed this game.\n\nThe story was decent\u2014not groundbreaking, but solid enough to keep me engaged. What really hooked me, though, was the gameplay and the world itself. The spellcasting feels great, combat is fluid, and the sheer amount of things to explore and interact with made it hard to put down. Hogwarts is packed with detail and secrets, and I found myself constantly distracted (in the best way) just roaming around.\n\nEven without the nostalgia factor, this game stands strong. If you're into action RPGs with a rich, interactive world, definitely give it a shot.\n\n9/10 \u2013 Would recommend, even to fellow Muggles.", 0.6319608688354492], ["Review after finishing the main story.  TLDR, the story's good and the atmosphere is great.  I found the game itself tedious.  If you are a Potterhead and are looking for a good story, this has that.\r\n\r\nMy main gripe with the game is that it feels like at some point this was intended to be an MMO.  And then later on, they decided they were not going to be able to do that so made it single player instead.  There's side quests everywhere and tons of world to explore if you are into that.  There is also a huge 'checklist' style approach to things to do in the overworld.  There's a big emphasis on cosmetic items as well.  For many people, these things are a draw but for me it just makes me tired.  I didn't find much actual good reason to go out of my way to explore as all of the 'impressive' things you can find are level adjusted gear that you'll replace in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nThey did try to gate some things behind exploring.  I really wasn't into this either.  The worst example I can find is that your inventory slot count is tied to how many optional Merlin trials you seek out and complete in the overworld.  Having limited inventory slots means that you have to stop what you are doing and arrange your inventory right in the middle of doing something more fun.  Capping that and hiding the larger caps under optional things to seek out and find is certainly a choice that they made in this game; and I'm not here for that.\r\n\r\nThe story is pretty good though.  The setting is prior to all of the other Wizarding World stuff I am aware of in the 1800's.  You are starting the game as a new student at Hogwarts starting in their 5th year.  They did find in-game justification for the world exploration checklist and map system, which I thought was cute.  Hogwarts and the surrounding area are really well done too.  I actually did get lost in Hogwarts a few times.\r\n\r\nCombat is a bit like the Batman Arkham games, but you are approaching it as a wand-weilding wizard.  You'll get dodge/parry prompts around your head, there's stealthy spots, you can see through walls, and sometimes you'll need to match the right spell to the right enemy action.  I felt like it was more than a bit easy though.  The main story has a pretty high amount of combat to go through.\r\n\r\nSo in conclusion, there's a lot for a person who is really into Harry Potter.  Its getting a no from me.", 0.6045518517494202], ["your choices don't actually affect the outcome, and the game keeps crashing every time i try to use ancient magic on a boss.", 0.583783745765686], ["Hogwarts Legacy is a visually stunning game that fully captures the magic and atmosphere of its setting. Exploring Hogwarts and its surrounding areas is an absolute joy, with incredible attention to detail that really brings the world to life.\r\n\r\nHowever, while the world design is top-tier, the storytelling falls a bit flat. The story is just straight up boring, lacking the emotional depth or memorable characters that could have elevated the experience. The dialogue is particularly weak\u2014often sounding stiff and robotic, which further disconnects players from the narrative.\r\n\r\nGameplay is solid, with fun spell combat, exploration, and customization options that allow you to feel like your own witch or wizard.

The problems with this game are the story, difficulty, puzzles, gear, achievements, and more.\r\n\r\nThe story is just plain boring and the dialogue options have no effect on the outcome of anything. Forget trying to roleplay as anything with the dialogue. \r\n\r\nThe progression and difficulty in the game is one of the worst I've seen from high production value games. There is no sense of getting stronger against enemies in this game and instead, they all scale to your level no matter what. This leads to the problem of the hard difficulty always locking every enemy to 3-5 levels above you. Forget doing side quests to feel stronger against enemies in the main story, the fights will always take the same length no matter what.\r\n\r\nThe puzzles are interesting the first few times you find a new puzzle but once you've seen all 4-5 varieties then you get tired of it all. It doesn't help that the puzzles give you pages which is the easiest way to get XP that I've found on my own. \r\n\r\nThe chests drop gear at your level forcing you to keep opening chests to get better gear.

I've tried playing this game, I think three times, and each time, after a few hours, I just uninstalled it.\n\nLet's start with spells. This game is literally about the wizarding world and magic, so I was thinking (probably not only me) how many amazing spells we would be able to use here. Nope - you get like 20-something spells. With bugged mods, you can probably get up to 30. And they're nothing special. If you thought you\u2019d be able to become another young Dumbledore, you're wrong. If you thought this game will beat Skyrim's magic system, you're also wrong. Huge disappointment.\n\nEnemies - nothing special. But that's on me, because personally I love games where I can duel with powerful, human enemies or climb up a ladder made of them, starting with lower bosses and continuing through the game, fighting more and more powerful ones. I had high expectations and can only blame myself for thinking that once I finally got to play a game set in the Harry Potter world, I\u2019d get to face some interesting villains similar to Voldemort or Grindelwald. But no - it's just mean goblins and not-so-evil tiny little poachers who are no match for a fifth-year Hogwarts student and get killed like flies.\n\nRepetitive missions and side \"jobs\" (because they surely can't be called quests): Merlin Trials, those f***ing moths, doors with symbols and other buggers. Reminds too much annoying MMORPG quests like go collect 15 flowers or kill 20 bats. Main quests? Once you did the first trial, you can be sure the rest will be exactly the same, with just slightly more difficult puzzles to solve or bigger stone knights to defeat. Uninteresting.\n\nLast but not least - Hogwarts, praised by many, but in my opinion, it\u2019s just weird and not how it was described or how it should be. From the outside, it looks magnificent, just as it should - after all, they had eight movies and plenty of iconic scenes to draw inspiration from. But inside, it often feels like a strange mix of clashing styles from different eras. In the parts of the castle where they had to design things themselves (instead of directly copying from the films), it ends up looking more like some kind of Rothschild palace from the 18th century.
