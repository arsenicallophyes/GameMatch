I could not hate this game more than i do. I load onto a server and get my ballsack smashed everytime i try to walk off of the spawn beach, i cannot find a singular piece of cloth anywhere on the entire fucking 30 grid map. I love spending time just to either get offlined by a shitty chinese man with 23 hours on the game or get onlined in my 2 by 2 by a 20 man russian zerg that has never left their homes in saint petersburg, Russia whos pc's run for 189.778 hours a week afking their 4 grid long and 7 grid wide base making sure they dont get offlined while their tm8s off of cragislist farm sulfur to raid another 2 by 2.

The learning curve is less of a curve and more of a vertical wall. Death results in the loss of your entire inventory, followed by the pleasure of being spawn camped and raided at 2:00 AM by dedicated Eastern European players. They thoughtfully max out their mics and scream at you in Baltic languages over proxy chat, adding a personal touch to the experience. Wild animals round out the fun by routinely beating you to death.
