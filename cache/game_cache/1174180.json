Imagine needing to grant extensive access to your PC just to play an offline game\u2014sounds absurd, right? But that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening. The game now demands permissions to read my system and run in the background. For what purpose? It\u2019s invasive, unnecessary, and raises serious privacy concerns.\nTo make matters worse, the update seemingly restricts tools like IP blockers or changes\u2014tools that many rely on for cybersecurity and protection against hackers. Instead of safeguarding us from vulnerabilities, this move feels like gamers are being put in harm\u2019s way while also being stripped of control over their systems.\nThis level of overreach is unprecedented. No game should demand this much access to a user\u2019s PC. I believe it\u2019s time to take a stand\u2014not only for our own privacy but for the entire gaming community.\nFor those who feel the same, reach out to Rockstar and demand accountability. Request refunds if needed. Let platforms like Steam know about these over-the-top permissions. Spread awareness and encourage others to hold companies like this accountable. Rockstar has 30 days to issue a full refund or address these concerns appropriately.\nTogether, we can send a message: our privacy matters, and we won\u2019t compromise just for the sake of a game.", 0.6336989998817444], ["The best game I've ever played in my life.

Also, this is my second time buying this, gave it rave reviews on PS4. But this account linking stuff is nonsense. Not all players want to go online anyway, so save that as a prompt for if you open the online section, simple. However, forcing it on every user who buys it, is reprehensible, especially knowing how you milk your games more than any company in the history of gaming.

Hunting is a new addition, but it does not feel significant as it could have been. The in-game economy is also flawed - while making money is a core motivator, there\u2019s little to spend on. I also ran into the issue of getting a bounty out of nowhere, and losing honor for actions like looting corpses feels unfair. Still, gameplay remains enjoyable overall, even if it is not particularly innovative or highly interactive.\n\nMy biggest complaint with the game is the control: since almost every interaction requires holding buttons, it feels slow and inconvenient. It was designed to mitigate wrong input, but oddly, picking up weapon is one of the few interactions that only takes a quick tab \u2013 the same as holstering weapons. As a result, you often change weapons by mistake when you merely want to holster them. There's also an issue with interacting with objects: prompts often fail to appear unless you adjust the camera just right, and sometimes you can \u201cselect\u201d certain items at all if it happens to have multiple interactive items in the vicinity.\n\nEven though the game was released in 2018, it still holds up as one of the best-looking games today, but only if you figure out the complex graphics settings, otherwise, it may look blurry and run poorly. But with the right tweaks, the world is just stunning, not just because of the beautiful landscapes and realistic western towns, but also how Rockstar built the world is amazing. The way people behave, the tone they talk, the activities they have and the thoughts they hold \u2013 all are brimming with a deep sense of history and culture. This rich cultural atmosphere makes the world feel genuinely lived-in and authentic.\n\nHow the world interacts with players is also very refreshing. In typical open worlds, like those lifeless checklist open worlds from Ubisoft, players are asked to grind event icons on the map. To me, it feels like players have to deliberately push things to happen, otherwise, the world remains static. In Red Dead Redemption 2, there is no overwhelming number of icons. Instead, events unfold naturally as you explore \u2013 you might encounter random events that turn into mini quests, discover secluded locations with secrets and backstories, or meet NPCs who have interesting information to share. The world feels dynamic and alive, like players just happen to be in the right place at the right time, giving a strong sense of \u201cencounter\u201d.  I think that is why the world is so immersive.\n\n\nThe story features a lot of characters, and each develops through character specific quests. Honestly, quests are not enough in terms of number and depth for such a large cast of characters. However, from what it has, I think the game still does a good job of establishing key character traits with concise dialogue and thoughtful plotlines. More importantly, it portrays characters with both their beautiful and ugly sides, adding the complexity that makes characters human. It is rare to see stories where characters aren\u2019t just simple black and white, and this nuance gives the story much stronger emotional impact and greater depth. The extraordinary writing brings a soul to the game.\n\nThe lingering music and outstanding voice acting definitely add more flavors to the game, but at the end of the day, it is the immersive world and exceptional writing that make it one of the greatest games of all time. Surely, the game is a slow burn, with control feeling clunky at first and several gameplay flaws, but once the game starts to click, it becomes an unforgettable experience.", 0.5507985949516296], ["The game can and will crash at random, whether it be a driver issue or otherwise.

I\u2019ve played a lot of games, but very few hit as hard as this one. It pulls you in with its beautiful open world, its insane level of detail, and most of all, its characters. Arthur Morgan is one of the greatest protagonists ever written. Not just in gaming. You watch this man wrestle with guilt, loyalty, and redemption in a world that\u2019s slowly dying around him. His journey is powerful, but also heartbreaking. And it\u2019s not the kind of heartbreak that\u2019s forced or cheap\u2014it\u2019s slow, quiet, and painfully human. The way it all plays out? It gutted me.The story itself is incredibly well-written and mature. It takes its time, gives room for every moment to matter, and when it chooses to break you, it really does. It\u2019s rare to see a game with that kind of emotional weight. And none of it would land if it weren\u2019t for how alive the world feels. The open world isn\u2019t just big, it\u2019s believable. Every inch of it has purpose, and even the most mundane moments feel special because of the way it's presented.
