I am 84 years old.\nWhen I retired, my only daughter bought me a computer with a copy of the game Mid-town Madness, to keep my occupied during my retirement, and I had played it for 20 years until the computer stopped turning on.\nMy daughter passed away during the Pandemic, but last week my grandson Jason showed me Europe Truck Simulator and gave me his old computer to play it on. Thank you Jason. This game has reminded me not only of the enjoyment I got from Mid-town madness but of times gone by, when I was a trucker. Even though I proudly voted for Brexit, a decision I will never regret, I enjoyed a life driving all over Europe during my golden years. This game has brought back those lovely memories.\nI play this game on my grandsons old computer, his steam account he calls his \"troll alt\", and a steering wheel that I have plugged into my computer.

The truck just steers to much or too little with my controller.", 0.5007342100143433], ["I spent the last 15 years playing ETS, and I hate this game and it's developers every year more and more.\nThis game has huge problems that are not adressed for years. This is one of the most popular games in the world with SO MUCH potential and it is still popular not becuase of the developers, but despite them. The state of the game in 2025 clearly shows how the developers just don't care about the game and just barely make small changes to make the illusion that it is still beign developed somehow.\n\n-the game is unplayable without mods and with them it is only barely acceptable. \n-the developers should have switched to different engine years ago. The technological limitations of the engine for this type of game is unbearable in modern gaming, I mean look on the wet road when it rains. Even some games from 2007 did it better.\n-Where other companies in other genres like microsoft flight simulator already have procedurally generated environment, SCS still only make new maps extremely slowly manually with original tools in extremly compressed scale and there is no hope that this will change any time in far or near future.\n-The most tragic thing on this game is the AI. Even some games that are developed by a single developer can do 100x better. Just try City Car Driving from 2016. That game had literally no budget and the traffic feels alive, it reacts to you and the roads and traffic rules feel real. When I played that game I realised that SCS are just incompetent when they can't even make the easiest highway driving with traffic feel real after so many years.\n-Crashing physics feels like need for speed II from 1997 even that was more realistic. \n-The sound design from SCS is so terrible in EVERY aspect of the game that when I played for 10 minutes without ZEE mods I had to check if my sound system is not broken. I don't understand why companies that provide licenses for their trucks in the game have no problem with that awful sound of the engines but on the other hand don't want their trucks being physically destructed in the game itself. I think that former is a bigger problem if you want to promote your product through a game. (I love ZEE mods by the way, the most competent sound designer for trucks/cars in the world in my opinion)\n-VR optimazation. The company just does not give a f*ck about VR players. It feels horrible and stutters imensly even on more powerfull GPU's. I heard that VR version of the game would not even exist if one of the devolopers did not have it as side project, dont know if that is true but if yes hats off at least to this guy.\n-Another thing is the lack of multiplayer. I mean i dont really care that much about that but not having real multiplayer in a game like this is just mind blowing in 2025. I tried the moded multiplayer and it was horrible, too few players for such a big map and no AI cars (they are switched off so it would be at least a bit playable but that is not the solution) so it feels completely desolated.\n-SCS dont give a f*ck about modders, I mean PROmods is a must have for anybody these days and lack of cooperation with this comunity or other ones that creates free content for their own game is just stunning. Why the hell do you create new locations in the map where it is already done by someone else on even higher standard then your own ? I will never understand that.\n-Even with so many critical issues unresolved the game developer develops DRIVING SCHOOL module into the game. I thought I would cry when I saw that. I mean the cars in the game don't even know when not to give way, or you can't even set the width of the roads to a realistic setting but you create a driving school module... WTF!\n\nI feel like someone needs to develop a truck game from scratch because SCS software is just hopeless after all those years. The open world driving genre in general is extremely relaxing, profitable and has unlimited potential, but the lack of competition is really frustrating and I beg SCS to up their game (pun intended) or at least put it in hands of someone who cares !", 0.5005673766136169], ["superb game!! every time when i play it, it makes me peaceful, the nature while delivering cargo are amazing!!", 0.5], ["Playing this with a Logitech wheel and pedals feels pretty much like real world experience, I learned turning and so on playing this.", 0.5], ["Great only if you're way too bored and have to do nothing with your worthless life.
