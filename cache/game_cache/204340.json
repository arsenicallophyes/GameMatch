This game is not worth your time.\n\nFirst of all, I really like Serious Sam: The First Encounter and The Second Encounter. These games were massive, especially SS:TFE. They have their unique style, dynamic gameplay, and spectacular battle scenes.\n\nSo my expectations for the sequel were probably too high, I knew it was hard to compete with SS1. Despite the negative reviews, I decided to beat Serious Sam 2 just for the record to see the ending. Some might say, I could watch it on YouTube. But I usually prefer playing games on my own, even bad games. Also, YouTube was created in 2005, which is the same year I started playing SS2. During these 20 years, I switched to different PCs, but my SS2 saves were always there with me. I returned to the game from time to time to finally beat it in 2025. And here below is my honest opinion.\n\nPros: The graphics is nice for its time and still looks decent even in 2025. I have questions to the videos in standard definition, rendered on the game engine, but it's rather a technology limitation. There are lots of great game design ideas, too. Like, for example, using vehicles or levels with low temperatures. With the latest patches SS2 works fast and nicely on modern hardware and operating systems.\n\nCons: The game is too long, it is literally overblown with content: weapons, monsters, secret areas, cartoonish bright colors. It seems like the creators have implemented their every idea after a brainstorming session: good or bad, doesn't matter. The SS1 unique style is gone, it's a mix of everything now. Too cruel to be a childish game and not realistic enough for adults. Of course, Serious Sam is not about being serious, but the jokes here are extremely odd and silly. It was obvious that SS2 won't end the franchise, but the feeling of wasted time is the best way to explain what I thought while watching the end credits. \n\nI understand that SS2 is more like a comedy game, it makes fun of the most common cliches in the genre. Croteam had a chance to create a brilliant 3D-shooter if they could only filter their ideas somehow. Too bad, it is not only a terrible sequel, the game is a parody of itself and is just not fun to play.", 0.48029816150665283], ["I played this a lot when I was little, and I hate the last boss as I was not able to beat it :(, damn you big pyramid.", 0.5], ["Dear devs, please add achievements.\n\nThis game means so much to me....", 0.52173912525177], ["new visuals but same great gameplay", 0.523809552192688], ["the forgotten sam\nfor a reason", 0.4545454680919647], ["SAM, I AM! \n\nDont think, just shoot.\n\n8/10", 0.5], ["Serious & Funtastic", 0.5820887684822083], ["Best Game from back in the old days ever :)", 0.5004854202270508], ["\u0627\u0632 \u0639\u0644\u0627\u0642\u0647 \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0642\u062f\u06cc\u0645\u06cc \u0647\u0633\u062a \u062f\u0648\u0633\u062a\u0634 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0645 \u0627\u0648\u0648\u0641\u0641\u0641\u0641\u0641\u0641\u0641\u0641", 0.5], ["Serious game", 0.5004854202270508], ["best game ever", 0.5], ["Gun go brr", 0.5], ["Good", 0.5004854202270508], ["For me it will always be the best Serious Sam", 0.5], ["can't have sex with Sam tho", 0.5], ["Fun", 0.5004854202270508], ["Make this game canon again you cowards", 0.5]]}, "images": {"header_image": "https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/204340/header.jpg?t=1728688287", "capsule_image": "https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/204340/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1728688287", "capsule_image_v5": "https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/204340/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1728688287"}, "support": {"support_website": null, "support_email": null, "game_website": "http://www.serioussam.com"}, "developer": "Croteam", "owners": "2,000,000 .. 5,000,000", "tags": ["Action", "FPS", "Co-op", "Comedy", "Multiplayer", "Shooter", "First-Person", "Gore", "Funny", "Classic", "Singleplayer", "Adventure", "Indie", "Sci-fi", "Online Co-Op", "Colorful", "Great Soundtrack", "Atmospheric", "Boomer Shooter", "Difficult"], "languages": ["English"], "concurrent_plays": 77, "number_of_achievements": null, "categories": ["Single-player", "Multi-player", "PvP", "Online PvP", "Shared/Split Screen PvP", "Co-op", "Online Co-op", "Shared/Split Screen Co-op", "Partial Controller Support", "Includes level editor", "Remote Play Together", "Family Sharing"], "genres": ["Action", "Indie"], "short_description": "Serious Sam 2 is a shot of adrenaline to the hearts of first-person shooter fans across the world.
