And after finishing the final episode, I am left baffled wondering why the hell I put it off for so long. Half-Life 2 is a MASTERPIECE, plain and simple. Even more impressive of a game whenever all the minor details of it constantly remind you that it was released in 2004 and still plays/manages to be this good.\n\nThe game features a linear story where you're mostly just shooting through enemies with a variety of guns and weapons in order to get to the next section. On paper and in first reaction it seems standard and repetitive, but the level design, enemy types, and atmosphere constantly evolve in such a cinematic way that it never gets tiring and always feels immersive and challenging and ABOVE ALL: UNIQUE. The level design is OFF THE CHARTS here. Each chapter of the game's world so immersive that it feels like a movie unfolding in your hands. You feel the stakes, you feel the action, you feel the emotions, you feel the terror. Every aspect of the game design is an effort of 10/10 craftsmanship.\n\nAND THIS GAME CAME OUT IN 2004?!?! From the start of the game to its end you feel such a sense of progression that really is movie-esque. I keep referring to it as film-like but there really is no better way to describe it; Half-Life 2 is a proper story.  A unique and bizarre one with an atmosphere that is addicting to taste more of. Though the combat isn't crazily impressive, it's paced perfectly to allow the story all the room it needs to shine, which further immerses you the deeper into the Half-Life rabbit hole you get. And don't even get me started on the brilliant pick up/gravity gun system that allows for an absurd amount of creativity in how you chose to traverse a level or - furthermore - to fight (when guns aren't cutting it for you anymore).\n\nHalf-Life 2 is undeniably one of the greatest games of all time. I've heard it said for years and now I can finally say it myself. Definitely worth the purchase and full play through, and if you like it, you'll join the club of people impatiently waiting for a 3rd.\n\n(ps. It's never coming is it?)", 0.7406500577926636], ["This game is a true masterpiece of the gaming industry. I was 7-8 years old when I first tried it, and since then, I\u2019ve still enjoyed the memories. I\u2019ve played the entire campaign more than 20 times, including both Ep.1 and Ep.2. This game will never grow old, just as it will never be forgotten.\n\nPeople who live in post-Soviet countries will definitely feel this depressive, pale, grey vibe\u2014the understanding of inevitable horror, the senselessness of life, and the absence of a future. I was overwhelmed by all these feelings every time I played Half-Life 2.\n\nThis is my childhood. This is my nostalgia.
