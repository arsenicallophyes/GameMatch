This game just doesn't have that.\nWhen Lethal Company was still active with updates, it was incredibly enjoyable. I loved it and I think everyone else did too. Recently, however, the game has become irrelevant from lack of developmental progress. \nThis game did mean loads to me and the community it created, but it could have easily been so much more.\nWith how much money the developer made from this game, I would imagine that they would have spent some on meaningful development of this game rather than letting it rot.\nI hate to see such a legend of a game go, but right now more than ever it seems like it's on the road to becoming another dead indie game among the many others like it.\nOverall, it is a good game, but it is a dead one.
