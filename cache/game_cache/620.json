When i first played the original Portal, i did like the game but i wouldn't say i loved it. it was a neat little game that fit it's small scale very well but for me, it didn't have that \"uumph\" factor a lot of VALVe games have. No matter how much you liked the original Portal, you have to admit the final product did feel like a side project VAVLe didn't put too much effort into compared to their other games like Half Life 2 or Left 4 Dead.\n\nHere? They completely threw that. There's sooo many new ideas here, paced evenly so that all the new mechanics get their time to shine without it feeling overwhelming. The environmental storytelling, while not as eerie as the first in my opinion, sells it's fantasy much better than the first with all the different moods they tried to evoke here like the dilapidated and broken down test chambers from the first game, or getting to see [spoiler]Cave Johnson go from a young aspiring scientist to a desperate and broken shell of a businessman by listening to J.K Simmons wonderful audio logs.[/spoiler] The characters are so brilliantly written, they feel and act like real people and that trademark wit and sass from the first game is still here without taking away from the serious moments in the game. My only minor complaint is that i wish the game had more variety in how you could tackle the puzzles you're given because i feel like that would have given it more replay value and it would've let you be able to solve the puzzles faster in your own way.\n\nNonetheless, while i personally don't think this is VALVe's best game (i still think that title does to Half Life 2) the feats this game accomplished should not at all be ignored. Seriously what are you waiting for? The game on it's usual price is cheaper than a family meal and on sale it's the price of a KIt-Kat bar.

It immerses you well into the setting of the Enrichment Center and introduces you immediately to one of my personal favorite (and fan favorite) characters ever Wheatley who's companionship and goofy antics makes him a joy to have in the game. The new mechanics make solving puzzles fun and challenging at the same time and allows for more diversity in the testing chambers than previously before. The introduction of Old Aperture and the way it is used to purvey the beginnings and lore of the facility is done in a smooth and fascinating way. On top of all this, the visuals that go alongside the game are surprisingly good for their age and help you appreciate the vast and complex features of the facility. The Co-op content that happens after the main game's story has an insane amount of fun and well made levels. They do a very good job of including the challenging puzzles in tandem with making them fun to play with a friend.
