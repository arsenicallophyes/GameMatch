The skills are visually intensive, feel impactful, powerful. The boss fights are good, often have individual mechanics while being readable and well telegraphed. Learning a new raid is a satisfying experience, playing a raid is a satisfying experience. Getting into one - not so much.\n\nAnd this is where it all goes downhill. The game has multiple gear progression systems, which are both mandatory (to the point you can't enter an encounter without meeting some requirements) and VERY expensive. This creates a pretty unpleasant environment for players who don't want to spend either too much money or too much time in the game. And to make things worse, spending only too much time doesn't cut it. You get enough to meet the \"minimum requirements\" for the most recent content, but nowhere near enough to be considered \"strong\". As a result, the LFG experience is often extremely frustrating. You can legitimately spend more time trying to join or gather a group than you spend afterwards playing the raid. \n\nThis is what drove me away from the game in the end. I was playing the maximum allowed 6 characters in the endgame in order to maximize my income so that I could stay at the \"poorly geared\" category. It's exhausting and not worth it, despite the satisfying experience of the actual gameplay.\n\nI would gladly go back to the game in case they make a major overhaul of the endgame structure, scrap the multiple-character gold earning and reduce the power gap between the free-to-play users and the whales. Which is probably not happening, so I'll probably keep playing other games instead.", 0.7782060503959656], ["Better stay away for this gacha game before you fall into the addiction (I did).", 0.6694890856742859], ["Pro: 8/10 content (dungeons, bosses fights)\r\n       10/10 skins\r\n       8.5/10 graphic\r\n       10/10 cinematographic and music\r\n       7.5/ story line\r\n       ongoing updates and balance class \r\n       Even though, is seems that SG is listening more of the Asia community than the America or Europe, this game still has an active company which is looking for improving the game play experience and ease the difficulty of this game for new players. \r\n\r\nCon: 1.5/10 Community is extremely toxic and prefer to gatekeep 1640 chars in a 1620 content, making to lose a lot of time in lobby simulator.

There's a huge difference between a game designed to be fun, and a game designed to be engaging, and I feel like a lot of people struggle to understand that. Lost Ark's business strategy is literally create a problem to sell a solution. I'm convinced everyone who still plays it just has Stockholm syndrome, because that's what it felt like to me in hindsight.
