I have had no issues until CS:GO where hackers seemed to go unchecked and if you tried to report anyone valve wouldn't let you for a time and said they have a full proof anti-cheat method. CS2 was coming out and I was excited for it since it would be an upgrade to visuals and gameplay. It has some improvements but hackers are still a problem more in comp and premier than in casual surprisingly.\r\n\r\nSteam from the articles I have read are using AI and a report from another player to catch cheaters now, this however is showing false positives, there are videos discussing this in more detail where the number of \"caught\" cheaters has increased exponentially. I myself have not cheated in any game, ran any scripts, etc. Yet I have now been punished twice in two different pods of 5 despite no actual vac bans and no word on who was even suspected of cheating, instead we get a generic message of \"Irregular Gameplay\" and the whole team is penalized. First time was 20 hours, I figured I just won't play with those guys again as I only knew one of them anyways. The second time I met 3 clan guys friended one of them and ran with one of their friends and the match ended early. We were losing both matches by a lot and we suspected the top frag player on the other team of hacking given how great he was compared to everyone else. The second time was a 3 day cooldown and since I don't hack I opened a steam ticket and almost 3 days later there is no response. I have spent a lot of money on opening cases and everything so I find it very crappy that Steam/Valve has decided to ignore my ticket and derank me a second time on premier when I was not cheating at all.\r\n\r\nI have friends who play premier and I want to play with them which is why I was getting my rank up which peak was around 3500 which isn't very high. Most of my friends got theirs up to 10k+ and the game doesn't allow you to play if the level difference is too high, which I understand the reason is so players don't get boosted. My issue now is that I am forced to play with full randos as if I join a stack, I risk getting cooldowned again or banned if someone else is cheating or has \"Irregular Gameplay\". \r\n\r\nI will still play the game but I don't see a point in trying to do comp or premier anymore nor do I see the point in spending money in a game that allows actual cheaters to play the game while penalizing those it just thinks might be cheating. This makes me want to go to back to COD but most of my friends play CS2. If you are looking for a game to play competitive this game is definitely not it. \r\n\r\nCheating is not the only reason not to get this game, CS2 has been out for 2 years and I was a little down that they eliminated a lot of maps, but they brought new versions at the same time. They announced they were bringing new maps, for hostage rescue, there are only 2 maps where before we had more. I would have thought that we would get 2 new hostage maps but both times they released 2 maps for a total of 4, they were defusal maps and the first two weren't for casual or comp but only wingman (2 v2). They release skins and they are nice but cheating is a problem, since Q3 of last year flagging accounts who aren't cheating has been a problem and we still only have 2 hostage maps that one has always been since beta the other since 2000, 25 years old. Meanwhile most of the defusal maps are newer or have had major upgrades to design layout.\r\n\r\nIf you already own the game, sure you can keep playing it but if Valve/Steam continues in the direction they have been headed they will destory the player base for this game. If you don't own this game, I do not recommend you buy it and purchase price is they charge money to play premier/comp, 15 dollars.

But once you scratch the surface, the issues hit you like a flashbang to the face.\n\n\ud83d\udd38 CS:GO was just better. More features, better balance, less chaos. CS2 feels like a stripped-down, half-baked remake with prettier lighting. It lacks the polish and reliability that made CS:GO feel like home.\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Cheaters. Everywhere. Despite all the \u201cimproved anti-cheat\u201d talk from Valve, CS2 is swarming with wallhackers, spinbotters, and aim-assisted clowns. VAC is more of a meme than a system. You might get one clean match out of five \u2013 if you're lucky.\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Account leaks through streams. Let that sink in \u2013 people literally lost their Steam accounts just by watching CS2 streams on Twitch. No phishing, no clicking shady links \u2013 just watching a major event. And Valve? Dead silent. No statement, no apology, no help.\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Server quality is laughable. 64 tick servers in 2025 is just unacceptable. We were promised 128 tick \u2013 we got smoke gimmicks and laggy peeks. Rubberbanding, packet loss, and straight-up disconnects still happen.

No community servers, no classic modes, missing features from CS:GO that players used every day. And they\u2019re slowly trickling back... keyword: slowly.\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Matchmaking and ranks are a joke. The ranking system feels totally random. Win streak? You derank. Lose a game? Here's your promotion. No transparency, no logic \u2013 just vibes and suffering.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nCounter-Strike 2 could be amazing. The gameplay foundation is still gold \u2013 it's fast, competitive, and adrenaline-pumping.
