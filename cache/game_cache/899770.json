This game respects my time, and build choices. Each ability has its own specialization tree, meaning you\u2019re not just choosing skills\u2014you\u2019re shaping them. My Void Knight doesn\u2019t just deal damage; he travels through time to delete problems before they happen. Sometimes I don\u2019t even know what I killed. It just stopped existing. \r\n\r\nFeels like a power fantasy where the devs actually want me to have fun. I didn\u2019t have to watch a 3-hour math video to understand what I was doing. I didn\u2019t have to ask Reddit if my build would be viable in two weeks. And not once did a dev named Jonathan Rogers tell me to \u201ctrust the vision\u201d while gutting movement skills and calling it progress.\r\n\r\nHighly recommend, especially if you\u2019re burned out from GGG\u2019s \u201cvision.\u201d The only vision I\u2019m following now is the one from the Void.", 0.8661625385284424], ["Hey Boys,\n\nI sat down to try Last Epoch at 7 PM. Just a quick session, I said\u2014stretch the legs of my Sentinel a bit before bed. Somehow, I woke up and the clock said \u201ctomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe night disappeared, my back ached, and my eyes were dry, but my soul? Rejuvenated. I hadn\u2019t felt this hooked since someone dared me to finish a pint of ice cream at 2 AM\u2014only this time, the stakes were higher.\n\nThere\u2019s a certain magic when a game keeps you up all night without regret. That \"just one more echo\" feeling hit different in Last Epoch. Suddenly it's 6 AM, and I\u2019m facing down death itself with a sword that glows like holy vengeance.\n\nLook, I\u2019ve spent my fair share of time in Diablo 4\u2019s dungeons and Path of Exile\u2019s labyrinths of currency systems. But Last Epoch? It\u2019s the game that stole my heart like a rogue with a silver tongue and god-tier crit chance.\n\nWith Tombs of the Erased (Season 2) coming in hot, Last Epoch is doubling down. The new zones are drenched in eerie beauty\u2014fog, crypts, and atmospheric lighting that looks like it was blessed by Hades himself. It doesn\u2019t just look good; it feels hauntingly alive.\n\nThe visual design is cinematic in the most unpretentious way. It doesn't shout, \"look at me!\"\u2014it whispers, \u201cstay a while\u2026 lose sleep.\u201d And buddy, I did.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk Paladin. My Sentinel didn\u2019t just put on armor\u2014he became divine wrath incarnate. Every hammer smash is like a sermon in steel.\n\nI don\u2019t play the Paladin, I become the Paladin. Aura of Judgment lights up the screen like the northern lights in a thunderstorm. You don\u2019t fight enemies\u2014you redeem them\u2026 into ash.\n\nThere\u2019s something holy and unhinged about channeling godly power in a system this refined. It\u2019s not just another tanky melee\u2014it\u2019s a cathedral with legs. And those legs are kicking straight through corrupted souls.\n\nAnd oh man, the way gear supports your fantasy? Chef\u2019s kiss. I\u2019m out here crafting swords with six blessings and a dream.\n\nWhich brings me to the crafting system\u2014it\u2019s actually fun. It respects your time, your intelligence, and your desire to make stuff that matters. It\u2019s like IKEA, but if you were building divine judgment instead of bookshelves.\n\nCompare that to Diablo 4\u2019s bland roll-the-dice upgrades. Or PoE\u2019s \u201cwhat does this fossil do again?\u201d roulette wheel. Last Epoch knows what you want: control, clarity, and chaos in equal measure.\n\nWant to try a new build? Go nuts. Respeccing is easy, so you\u2019re never punished for curiosity\u2014PoE2 could never.\n\nAnd yeah, let\u2019s talk offline mode. Sometimes I want to unplug from the world but still sling hammers through time. Last Epoch gets that, while Diablo 4 is still tying your gameplay to server status and weather patterns in Ohio.\n\nThis game doesn\u2019t just let you play\u2014it invites you to. Whether you\u2019ve got five minutes or five hours, there\u2019s always something meaningful to do. And that, my friends, is a modern miracle.\n\nThe time-travel setting? Criminally underrated. You\u2019re not just clearing monsters\u2014you\u2019re rewriting history, one legendary drop at a time.\n\nEach era has a vibe, a soul, and enemies that look like they crawled out of a prog metal album cover. I\u2019ve seen beetles made of bone and fire that would make H.R. Giger weep. And yes, I clicked on every one of them.\n\nThe devs at Eleventh Hour Games have managed something special. They didn\u2019t just make an ARPG\u2014they made the ARPG. If ARPGs were pizza, Last Epoch would be that corner slice with just the right amount of crispy cheese.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget about the monolith system\u2014randomized, layered, and dripping with loot. Every choice you make echoes through time and reward. It\u2019s a roguelite nested inside an ARPG wrapped in a love letter to the genre.\n\nEvery time I log in, I find a new interaction I didn\u2019t notice before. An affix here, a synergistic node there\u2014it\u2019s like discovering a secret level inside your own brain. And suddenly, my Paladin isn\u2019t just good\u2014he\u2019s divine and stylish.\n\nThe combat? Smooth like jazz, but deadly like a lightning storm in plate armor. Responsiveness like this should be illegal in half-finished AAA games.\n\nDiablo 4 may have the budget, but Last Epoch has the soul. PoE2 may have depth, but Last Epoch has design that respects you from hour 1. You\u2019re not playing a spreadsheet\u2014you\u2019re playing a masterpiece with a damage multiplier.\n\nJudd Cobler\u2014sir, madman, genius\u2014thank you. You and your team have created something timeless, pun fully intended. You gave us a game that lets us wield gods, time, and flaming swords on a Tuesday night like it\u2019s nothing.\n\nSo yeah, I stayed up all night. I don\u2019t regret it. In fact, I might do it again tonight\u2014because Last Epoch is the best thing to happen to ARPGs since the mouse.\n\nThank you kindly,\n\n-ruthless", 0.8433258533477783], ["Amazing game.

They've practically perfected the classic ARPG formula with this patch.\nVery excited for future updates!", 0.6178043484687805], ["Wish there was a meh option instead of yes or no.\nOver all I'd unironically say 6.9/10.\nIf you enjoy Diablo 3/4, or PoE1 this game will be more up your alley than PoE2 or Grim Dawn.\nGlad theres good ARPG competition in this space. It was dull for a while. This game is probably going to be great for most ARPG fans, but for me it just doesn't cut it. Gameplay just falls flat at the end of the day.\nThere's a lot going for this game, but I'd rather just play PoE1 if I want the blasting / nothing is threatning till high endgame.\nAll my cons are things that can be fixed, but even if they were all fixed I still just don't think this game feels that good over all. I prefer the heavy hitting / weighted attacks of PoE2/Grim Dawn.\n\nPros:\nGreat crafting system.\nFeels very responsive. Click button, Action Happen. This is nice, but it does make a lot of skills feel somewhat similar at the end the day.\nUI is clean and pretty easy to get around. I like how it tells you what you will lose and gain from switching items. Also nice scaling options in the settings. It also tells you how you died. Very underrated feature.\nHas offline mode.\nCrafting materials don't take up storage space.\nCan buy extra storage space for in game gold.\nImplicit movement speed on boots. \nCan respec just about everything just for gold.\n\nCons:\nZERO feel of threat during the campaign. Campaign is so boring. You just end up using a traveling skill to get to the next exit. Skip monsters because they're no threat and you're fast as fuck boy. Too much random teleporting through rifts. The in game \"cut scenes\" and cinematics are absolutely terrible. Don't want to go through this again and again.\nNot enough weight to attacks. Feels like you're throwing pebbles / slapping things most the time and enemies don't really feel it.\nPhysics are way too floaty. This makes it feel cartoonish.\nMight as well use Mouse1 to move. Can't have interact/attack on Mouse1 when using WASD. Wish interact / move were seperated in this case. Makes WASD not feel as good as it could.\nNo pausing when in online mode. :(\nTravel moves run you into walls without smart tracking like in PoE2.\nNo big cursor option. I lose my cursor A LOT with all the stuff going on in game. Maybe this has to do with being on ultrawide, but it's pretty bad.\n\nMeh:\nEndgame is meh. I don't think anything needs to be done here but I just didn't enjoy it.\nWASD is a nice addition but ultimately you should stick to the classic controls.\nNeeds to be better sounds for when loot drops. You can hardly hear the noise it makes. All loot drops kind of feel the same because of this.\nZone entrances/exits have a huge radius that you can't walk in. Just think this feels bad in most places. Should be able to walk closer to the door you're entering.\nCan't use skins in offline mode.\nThe enemies you fight make too much noise. They're always grunting or screaming.", 0.6159926056861877], ["As a fan of ARPGs, I was excited to try this based on the reviews and recommendations. The build customization is awesome and I like the emphasis on crafting. However, I just couldn't get into the game as it never felt like there was any threat of dying or being skill-checked with my build. I just felt too overpowered and was bored with the gameplay and story. The game failed to hook me at six and half hours, which should be ample time to get into most games. I'm fine with the loss of $30 because I'm happy to support the devs, but this just isn't the game for me.", 0.6153276562690735], ["Currently the greatest challenge in the game is trying not to fall asleep.\n\nAt its core, an ARPG should present the player with challenges and long term goals, and offer ways of tackling them through itemization. Dying too often? Fix your defenses. Killing stuff too slow? Get gear upgrades. Having mana issues? Fix your sustain. Last Epoch fundamentally doesn't get this, since it never challenges the player in any meaningful way, until its too late. The player is a god from lvl 1, well into the end-game (yes, even in empowered monoliths) - you never feel the need for upgrades, because you're always ahead of the curve. As a result, long term goals feel hollow since your power fantasy is already achieved.\n\nPeople will tell you to push even higher corruption if you want some challenge, but by that point your build is essentially done, since all there's left to do is grind for the same gear with slightly bigger affixes. The game being braindead up until that point is a failure in design and removes any sense of progression.\n\nWhen you add the very monotonous content of monoliths (blast screens for 2 minutes, rinse and repeat), the paper thin end-game systems, forgettable mobs and the generally dated gameplay (combat lacks feedback and feels floaty), what begins as fun or engaging soon turns into something dull and predictable.\n\nIf you want to switch your brain off and blast screens while watching something on your 2nd monitor, this game will be perfect for you.

By the time I got to corrupted Monoliths, I was already bored to tears. When I found out that I would have to grind some more to scale them up to any challenging difficulty, I was done with it.\nThis is an issue for me.\n\nIf you like an ARPG that is fun for 15-30 hours and is easy to pick up.

No slot machine mechanics, the RNG gods smile upon  us. \n\n+ Amazing build options, with a more approachable learning curve than its real competitor in this regard: POE2. 5 classes with three unique evolutions each for a combined total of 15 to choose from, and now you can respec these mastery classes, encouraging experimentation at an increasing cost. \n\n+ Best Solo-Self Found experience in an ARPG, because of unique mechanics that help target farm desired items, alongside the crafting system. Unlike in POE2 where endgame is very much dependent on trade. \n\n+ Great endgame, I haven\u2019t reached season 2\u2019s just yet, but with the new additions to what I\u2019ve already played at launch and in season 1, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be a blast. \n\n+ Best loot filter in genre as well, and much easier to import than PoE2 or if you\u2019d rather make your own it\u2019s relatively simple. \n\n+ Can be played offline, both logged in and completely disconnected. Great for steam deck users who want an offline character to play anywhere in the world. \n\n+Indy devs, not only do you get to congratulate yourself for helping out the small guy. But you get devs who actively play the game and will even conversate with the general chat. \n\n\u2022 Art style is more bright and vibrant than PoE2, or Diablo 4. The setting takes place across multiple time periods so environments include lush green prehistoric jungles with bright red flowers, to barely intact landscapes with devastated ruins standing in purple and pinkish haze. \n\n\u2022 Campaign is decent but forgettable, don\u2019t expect blizzards level of shine here, this is a neutral point for me because beyond Diablo 4 I don\u2019t really care about story. \n\n- Graphics are inferior to modern standards, but if you can get past that you\u2019ll find they are still spectacular if maybe looking dated.
