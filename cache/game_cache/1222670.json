For you all it's free and for that it's good, but essentially it's just a marketing strategy for you to buy each DLC individually \u2013 which in turn means it's not really \"free\".

It's over. I feel sorry for you.\n\nI mean, with that money you can travel to Japan or buy a decent couch if there's a sale.\n\nMy message: Honestly, do whatever you want.

Yes, they made the game free, but that is because every DLC is the price of an ENTIRE game!! These DLC are small enough that they can make hundreds of them, too. ($900 for all of the DLC, and half of the content they add seriously should've been in the base game, but they intentionally leave it out so that they can get more profit later. would be better if the individual prices were lower or if they combined a lot of these dlc.) it used to be better...\n\nAs for game play, Sims 4 focuses on the sims relationships and actions more than the world. The world is NOT open and you only really focus on one building and its surrounding areas at a time. While this is a downgrade from Sims 3, the interaction, AI, and relationship dynamics are much more interesting and enjoyable in the Sims 4 over the Sims 3.", 0.5454545617103577], ["still a fantastic life sims game that offers endless creativity and fun. but i must admit the expansion packs often feel overpriced and fragmented.

Plus some expansions lack depth.", 0.5454545617103577], ["\"This game is an insult to gamers.\"\nI paid for The Sims 4 only to watch it go free while being locked out of what I paid for because of EA's dumpster fire of a launcher. It\u2019s not just the bugs, the crashes, or the constant updates breaking things\u2014it\u2019s the sheer disrespect for paying customers.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the $2,028.06 worth of DLC. Yes, you read that right. A full collection of Sims 4 content costs more than most gaming PCs. It\u2019s a blatant money grab disguised as a life simulator, squeezing every penny from loyal players.\n\nEA\u2019s business practices have been shady for years: overpriced DLCs, pay-to-win mechanics, and now a launcher so bad it makes me nostalgic for the days of CDs. If you want to alienate your player base and push people to other platforms, congrats, EA, you\u2019re doing a fantastic job.\n\nInstead of building trust, they double down on greed, and the result is a franchise that used to be beloved but is now a hollow cash grab. Gamers deserve better than this corporate nonsense.", 0.5395127534866333], ["Bought the game roughly 10 years ago. Had a lot of fun for 10 hours or so, but ran out of interesting stuff to do and moved on. Felt like playing again after a while and had fun for 2-4 hours before realizing i was doing the same things as my first save and once again ran out of stuff to do. Couple years later, bought DLC during a sale and had fun for a few hours before once again feeling like i had my fill of the gameplay loop. Now in 2025 i feel like i would like to play for a bit once again, but i know it will be the same gameplay loop as last time unless i buy more DLC. \n\nEvery other game I've owned for 10 years has had countless content updates or at least a squeal/successor. The Sims 4 has simply had more DLCs. If i want to play other 10 year old games with all their new content updates, i just play them and do so. With The Sims 4, if i want to play a 10 year old game with all its content updates, then i need to pay (at the time of writing) $1,400 USD for all the DLC they've pumped out in that same time. Now you could argue that most of that is cosmetic packs, but just one of the most recent actual content update packs costs $40 USD; this more than i had payed for the actual game originally before it went F2P.\n\nAll in all. If you've never played any of The Sims games, its worth it for as long as you're entertained without buying any DLCs. If you do buy any, you will get bored of them just as quickly you did the base game and feel the need to buy another. And another. And another.

The only places to go are the bar, the gym, the park, and the \"lounge\"\u2014you can't even go have dinner at a restaurant or anything like that\u2014and I'm honestly just kind of disappointed with the content available in such a flagship AAA series. This DLC backlog also makes Stellaris' and Crusader Kings' look like an honest bargain, it's nuts.\nMaybe my thoughts will change if I give it more time. I still haven't tried mods as of writing this, but as it stands, vanilla Sims 4 just doesn't engage me at all.\n\n[b]EDIT:[/b] \nSo I've been messing around with Sims 4 mods, and I guess the game's a little better. It's still not very great. Like, I'm happier now that I've learned I can enable \"no trespassing\" to keep randoms from knocking on the door, and I guess it's nice that I can mod more guitars in where the game only had like three. But I'm still disappointed that the actual simulations only seem to happen in the small area that you're in. Every person in the world does regular walks down your street at least once a week, probably because they just wouldn't exist if they didn't.\nAnd I just don't like that making friends means that your friends spend half of their waking lives on your couch, watching your TV, (poorly) playing your instruments, or browsing your books until they [i]need[/i] to be somewhere else. Like I regularly have guests over until 2:00AM long after my sim's gone to bed, just making themselves at home. I also don't like that I can't go literally next door without facing a loading screen.\nI thought the game might turn around if I gave it some more time, tried modding through what I didn't like, and really tried to enjoy it.
