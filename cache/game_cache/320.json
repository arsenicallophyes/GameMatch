Servers have the expected chaos in them, with people using the gravity gun to yeet radiators into their opponent's cranium, which will forever be the most humourous thing to be a feature in a multiplayer game. All of this can probably be done in Gmod but this game's community has it's own fun charm to it, so I recommend checking this game out if you can. Of course the game is Multiplayer only, and some servers are more like Gmod servers rather than Deathmatch servers, but getting into the right server can result in you having a blast so yeah.", 0.5669291019439697], ["i liked it\ngame is currently held together by russian servers and duct tape but back in the day this was fun", 0.5384615659713745], ["My favourite half life game\r\nso much fun I love this silly thing\r\nonly wish is that it got combined into half life 2 like episode 1 and 2 so it had more players", 0.519817054271698], ["they made half life 2 multiplayer, and its so fun", 0.5], ["This game is funny because i can throw with gravigun toilets and barrels in enemy they will die .

Forget graphics and RTX light and \"cosmetics\". Half-Life 2 Deathmach (AKA simply dm) has the rules of \"nature\" and the tools combination to find yourself in a totally unique situation and ALWAYS extremely comic. For example in lockdown there is a half height wall at the washing hall. I was on one side of the wall my friend on the other. we could not see eachother but we both balance the situation on what to do. I just grab with the gravity gun a \"lavomano\" bring it upper from the wall to the other side and without seeing where is my friend I just launched it to his face. He just saw a \"lavomano slowly passing over the wall, getting right in his face and launched.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nBUT, never forget the really poor behavior of the dm creators that they totally abandon their creativity to just make a global \"hats\" casino, unregulated and accessible to children.
