I gave it a shot on a friend's recommendation, expecting a thrilling heist experience, but the constant barrage of action, noise, and chaos was overwhelming rather than exciting.\n\nThe premise is solid\u2014you and your crew are robbing banks, pulling off heists, and trying to outsmart the law. The cooperative aspect is key, and there\u2019s definitely a sense of satisfaction when everything goes smoothly... though that's pretty rare. The game thrives on loud, all-out action, and if you\u2019re into frantic firefights with the police, this is your playground. But for me, it\u2019s a bit too much. The constant gunfire, alarms blaring, and non-stop pressure made it hard to enjoy the planning and execution of the heists.\n\nI\u2019m sure there are stealthier options for pulling off heists, but honestly, the chaos and loudness often seemed unavoidable. I get that it\u2019s a big part of the game\u2019s appeal, but it felt like the experience was more about surviving the chaos than actually executing a well-planned job. The game does offer a lot of content, and there\u2019s a lot of depth in terms of customizing your character and planning out your approach, but the constant noise and confusion just didn\u2019t sit right with me.\n\nWhile I can see the appeal for fans of fast-paced, cooperative action, I personally would go for something with less of a sensory overload. It\u2019s fun for some, but for me, Payday 2 felt more like a frantic, loud mess than a strategic heist experience. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d recommend it to people who prefer more structured, less chaotic co-op experiences.[/b]\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Solid co-op mechanics for players who enjoy chaotic action\n[*]Deep character customization and progression\n[*]Variety of heist options and environments\n[/list]\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Too chaotic and loud for my taste\n[*]Hard to enjoy stealthy heists with the constant action\n[*]May not appeal to players looking for a more controlled experience\n[/list]\n[b]If you love fast-paced, chaotic heist action, Payday 2 might be right up your alley. But if you're looking for something more methodical and less noisy, I\u2019d recommend looking elsewhere.[/b]", 0.6088714599609375], ["This game is so good even today, you can't really get board of a game like this I recommend playing this game, there is so many things you can do and different play styles you can do, every heist will be different depending on what skills, equipment, and weapons you bring. 10/10 its worth buying", 0.5459616184234619], ["very good gameplay even this is an old game, but still the community still lives on until now", 0.523809552192688], ["Payday manages to be fun, while also not being fun whatsoever. Horrendous grind, quickly repetitive gameplay, extremely satisfying looting and actions, poor stealth, fun combat. If I had to evaluate Payday with all the time I've put in, and all the moment's I've got back, I realise that it was the people I played with that made the game fun, barely the game itself. \n\nPayday is fun when you have hours to throw away into the grinder of retying stealth missions and endlessly repetitive loud missions; Payday is fun when you finally stealth the big heists like Big Bank and The Golden Grin Casino. Payday is fun when your using the most absurd weapon, while wearing the most absurd clothes, while robbing the most absurd bank. Payday is not fun when you lose a perfect run to a bug; Payday is not fun when the monotony gets the better of you, when the weapons, enemies, and maps, all blend together.\n\nI wish Payday was worth it. I wish it was worth it to learn the good maps and dlc's; worth it to find the good weapons and the most fun builds, but its not. Payday is not worth it. It takes too much time, asks to much of you, and doesn't give back what you deserve. Play a better game, that the fate of Payday; always to come back after a couple of years or months, when you forget the repetitive nature of all its mechanics, when it becomes fresh and new again. Only for a few heists later when that monotony starts to creep back in. \n\nPayday is not worth it. It was fun, and will always be fun; but it will never be worth it.", 0.52173912525177], ["Amazing game 10/10, came from playing it on console. Beautiful.

I love the DLC (though a lot of stealth and loud loadouts and other things require DLC, yikes), I love the maps, teamwork, and especially the people you'll meet while playing this game. Some people can be douchebags, yes, but I've met super awesome people playing this game that wouldn't mind helping beginners. Better yet, get your friend(s) to play this game with you! Don't be deceived by how old it is, and PAYDAY 3 is kinda doodoo. I have a lot more hours on console, which is more limited, and the PC version has SO much more to offer.\r\n\r\nIMHO, 8/10. -2 for being so DLC heavy, but that's what happens when a game is this successful for so long.", 0.5], ["Payday 2 is just one of those games I will never be able to put down forever. Every couple of months, or years, I get that itch to pull off a heist, or to sneak into the white house. And when I see those 0's direct deposited into my bank account, it feels just as good as my first time (pause). I always end up getting tired of it again eventually, but that's okay cause I can never stay away forever. Payday 2 is a flawed game, and Overkill has done some very questionable things with the pricing of the base game and DLC, but with the strength and resolve of the PD2 community, this game will live on forever. Think of PD2 as the CS:GO of heist games; it's that damn replayable. ONLY get this game when it is on sale, and do not buy every single DLC you see.

Le r\u00e9alisme des braquages est bien plus pouss\u00e9, avec des missions plus vari\u00e9es et des strat\u00e9gies plus complexes \u00e0 mettre en place. Les braquages sont styl\u00e9s, chaque mission \u00e9tant une v\u00e9ritable aventure o\u00f9 chaque d\u00e9cision compte.

Les diff\u00e9rentes classes de personnages et le syst\u00e8me d\u2019am\u00e9lioration permettent de personnaliser ton exp\u00e9rience selon ton style de jeu.\r\n\r\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9, PAYDAY 2 est un excellent jeu de braquage, encore plus r\u00e9aliste et fun que son pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur.
