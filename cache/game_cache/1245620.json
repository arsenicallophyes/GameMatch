I understand that a lot of my complaints apply to the Soulsborne series as a whole, so it seems pretty clear that the series is not for me.\r\n\r\nI really like that just about every mob can be a real threat and should be treated as such, and that you really have to be conscious about not letting yourself get surrounded. Some of the special weapon moves can feel really satisfying if pulled off. But that's about the last good thing I have to say about the combat.\r\n\r\nUltimately, I think the controls just feel too jank for what the game demands of you, especially against the bosses. Dodge rolling feels VERY inconsistent, as does whether or not my character will decide to drink their health potion when I press the button. I really hated getting stunlocked by bosses too. I get that part of the challenge is avoiding the initial hit that leads to the combo, but it made me feel helpless, rather than motivating me to improve.\r\n\r\nThe jank also extends to the exploration. The platforming feels absolutely awful, whether on foot or on horseback. The amount of times where it was literally the intended path to take a risky-looking jump off an innocuous-looking ledge bordered on absurd. It's crazy to me that a game that advertises its open world as including an interesting amount of verticality would contain no climbing mechanics or ways to interact with ledges besides awkwardly running off them. It was equally crazy to me that fast travel was the only way out of the Leonine Misbegotten arena. Actively requiring fast travel because there's no other way to exit an area feels like a violation of the open world promise.\r\n\r\nThe runes/souls system for levelling up and shopping is of course excellent, though the corpse running mechanic feels like it makes a lot less sense in an open world game as opposed to earlier, linear entries. Nothing discourages exploration like returning to the same area over and over again. I feel that the improvements I got from levelling up were far too granular, and I never really felt any more powerful leaving a Site of Grace because I saw a number increase from 103 to 105.\r\n\r\nMy final gripe is the way in which information is presented. NPCs speaking in cryptic riddles can be cool for dishing out lore, but I shouldn't be able to accept a quest and have no idea what I've actually been asked to do. I'm sure I won't be the first to complain that there is no quest log, which seems to be a pointlessly stubborn decision for a game of this scale. The menus are horrendous to navigate, and make very little sense. The game does not seem at all interested in teaching you its mechanics either. Most of what I learned was from wikis and Reddit posts, because the game was too obtuse to give me the info I needed.\r\n\r\nAll of this is a huge shame, because I really wanted to like the game. I was excited to see what all the fuss was about. It feels like this would be an incredible experience for anyone who already loves the Souls series, but it was just too hostile for this hapless first-timer.", 0.6284894347190857], ["[h2] Honest Review [/h2]\nPeak game, after approx 110++ hours i finally become the elden ring.

Despite that, Elden Ring still holds up with the rest of FromSoftware's games, but Dark Souls 3 is still at the top of that list.\n\nA visually stunning game both graphically and from a narrative perspective, the monotone colors captured the state the Lands Between is in and not to mention how it changes once you've progress in the story far enough.\n\nThe quests are impossible to find and continue without actively having a guide open, its not an issue to some but it is for majority of people I asked.  I just wish that the quests would stop being so obscure and just tell us where to go. having the lore hidden behind some item/random statue description is fine, but the quests should be less cryptic.\n\nThe bosses, a few stand out like Godfrey, Radahn, Maliketh and Malenia. but other than that, the others are pretty forgettable, definitely not as good as Dark Soul 3's boss lineup in my opinion.\n\nStill a great game to play in 2025\n", 0.6030357480049133], ["[h1]I was expecting too much from Elden Ring.[/h1] \n\nThe idea of FromSoftware making an open world game was tantalising, and I expected them to innovate not just on their souls mechanics and their general formula, but to innovate the way we perceive open-world games. I was waiting for a new take on the common open world formula that we're so used to by now. But I got none of that, Elden Ring still operates on the same open-world blueprint that was established by many open-world games before it. \n\nThe world that we\u2019re given however, is rich and lush, many creatures roam around in it, there are quite a lot of points of interests that are always in our view. It\u2019s very good at giving you the intrinsic motivation to continue exploring as much as you can. There are dungeons to be explored, bosses to be fought, creatures to be slain at every step. Plus the lands between are vast, with each area having its own appeal and atmosphere. And there are ways of completely bypassing certain areas or finding shortcuts to someplace else. I have never felt such strong sense of discovery with any open-world game before. \n\nBut being an open-world game, it comes with its own drawbacks, firstly you don\u2019t really have much incentive to slay any of the enemies that roam the open-world, you get almost nothing and just minimal runes for doing so, secondly, since you\u2019re building your character in a specific way, you will come across many interesting items, weapons and ashes of wars which might end up being completely useless to your build. The game certainly tries to balance it out by giving us a choice to respec whenever we want and to change certain aspects of our builds on the fly but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s enough. It does work for the overall replayability of the game, where you\u2019re not exploring anyway and are just doing boss runs, but it could\u2019ve been balanced better in my opinion. Quests are also brought back and this time we get a lot of affable characters we can spend our time with, but their quest-lines can be frustrating to play through. In other Froms\u2019 games, we\u2019re given more linear, metroidvania-esque worlds where questing can be easier since you will go back and forth and come across some characters in one way or another. But with Elden Ring\u2019s massive open-world, it becomes very hard to find characters and continue their quest-lines, especially because you can sometimes completely lock yourself out of some quests by unknowingly proceeding at a certain point in the main game. \n\nOnto the bosses, I found most of the main to be simply amazing. Elden Ring does this thing with it\u2019s bosses where, a lot of them have very off telegraphing on their attacks, which I found to be quite refreshing since before playing this game, I feared that they might\u2019ve just made the bosses even faster, and yes, there are some bosses that do follow that idea unfortunately, but most of the bosses are quite well balanced\u2026 well as balanced as they can be for a game like Elden Ring. Sometimes they do go overboard with it, like having [i]Malenia[/i] do her water-fowl dance, which doesn\u2019t even fit the game, it tarnishes the image of an otherwise exceptional boss in my eyes. But such moments are exceptions, not the rule. It\u2019s clear to me that they\u2019ve carefully crafted most of the main boss fights in the game. There are also side bosses, but they can range from boring/terrible to pretty good. These can be found in the dungeons or the over-world. \n\nSpeaking of which, the over-world comes with its own set of world bosses, you can find tree sentinels and several elemental dragons spread across the map which offer gear or dragon hearts, for certain spells if you are going for a draconic build. I do wish that they spent more time on refining certain moves for the dragons, most of them are quite same-ey. \n\nWe also get a completely new jump button, which might seem like a small thing to get excited about, but after playing through the game multiple times, it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s not just added as a novelty. It adds more depth to the platforming, and even to boss fights, you can completely dodge certain attacks with jumping and not only that, but you can also attack while jumping, getting in that extra damage that you can\u2019t deliver while simply rolling. Jump attacks do more damage too. You\u2019re given a choice, and I think that\u2019s the name of the game here. In Elden Ring, you\u2019re given a lot of choices, a lot of players have already said that Elden Ring is the most accessible game from FromSoftware\u2019s catalogue and I agree, you are given lots of tools, equipment, status effects, summons and even a whole new crafting system to play around with which can make things easier for all kinds of players. Crafting doesn\u2019t seem like a useful aspect in the game, but it has its place. You get to craft tons of items if you have the ingredients for them which may help you overcome that boss fight or help you explore the open world better. \n\nAfter playing Elden Ring, I realised that I was expecting too much from this game, I expected it to change everything about the open-world formula, and even though I have been quite critical of it, I still believe that it\u2019s still one of the best open-worlds I have ever gotten the chance to explore. There\u2019s a sort of a meditative quality to it, you\u2019re not pushed to do anything, you\u2019re not given a grocery list of chores like many other open-world games do. It\u2019s a huge world and it\u2019s yours to explore at your own leisure, as I mentioned, a game of this type works solely on whether you\u2019re feeling intrinsically motivated to explore it or not. To me, all the issues that I listed are present in all open-world games, I still believe that the open-world formula hasn\u2019t been used to it\u2019s fullest potential yet. I wanted Elden Ring to break out of the that mould and give us an open-world that is truly different, unique, and while it is a unique world with its own rich history, lore and the lush atmosphere that we\u2019re presented with, mechanically, it\u2019s still one of the many open-worlds that we\u2019ve gotten. But even so, I stayed thoroughly enchanted by the lands between, always wanting to go further, always wanting to explore even more.
