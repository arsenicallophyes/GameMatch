Just driving around admiring the view or making an incredible view of utter destruction, this game will show you things you have always wanted to see. The admiration and spectacular amount of effort the developers have done to make this remarkable game, will go down in history. Whether you want to race, crash, drift, drive, customize, etc. No matter what ideas you have, or what you want to do with vehicles or cars in general you have the freedom to do and choose every little detail. The amount of hours i have spent in this game do not matter as i would double or even triple it, if i had the chance to. If this game never existed, i do not know if i would be the person i am today without this game. BeamNG.drive has been there at my lowest and i will always come back to it, its just that dang good. If you put the effort in you can make many more things yourself to fill that void that might be missing in your life. This game has taught me even when you think things couldn't get worse, to always get back up and move forward with great strides. You might be brought down by the difficult burdens of life and i promise you, this game will be the torch that lights the tunnel. I guarantee you this game will be worth it regardless the price, and price doesn't matter when the product is sprinkled in the dust of angels and brought down for the world to experience. \n\nWhen i die, i will be commemorating BeamNG.drive on my tombstone, and i will die peacefully knowing i got to enjoy and pleasure myself with the greatest game of all time.\n\nThank you, BeamNG.drive developers, for giving me something to live for and enjoy for years to come, i greatly appreciate the honor you have bestowed upon me and others for being able to play such a masterpiece.", 0.5945945978164673], ["I put a rocket on a bus and flew it into the side of a cliff, 10/10.\r\n\r\nOff-roading physics like crawling, climbing, or Baja racing is far superior to any other game.

No dynamic mud effects on cars? Still no realistic tire smoke? No weather effects like rain or snow? And\u2014somehow\u2014still no official multiplayer?\r\n\r\nFor a game that prides itself on realism, these are huge gaps. It's wild that you can watch every nut and bolt fly off your car in a crash, but your tires stay sparkling clean in the mud, the smoke looks outdated, and you're stuck driving solo in an empty sandbox. No weather means no changing conditions, and no multiplayer means no racing, crashing, or just goofing around with friends\u2014arguably half the fun in any car game.\r\n\r\nBeamNG feels like a masterpiece engine trapped in a beta world.
