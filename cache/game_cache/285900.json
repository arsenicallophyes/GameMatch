I love this masterpiece of a game!", 0.5], ["\r\nGang Beasts is a fighting game where you can fight as different characters made of plasticine. For me, it's a banger and I also like that you can customize your character however you want. Also to mention that this game can be played up to 8 people. You can choose to play with random people or even with your friends. You can choose if you want to play local or online and you can also choose the map that you want to play on or you can set the map to be random. Cuztomization is cool because there are a lot of different things you can put on your character. Each map has it's own ambient and unique technics. Each round is up to 3 wins if you are playing with random players but you can customize the number of max wins if you play with your friends. Each map takes about 3-5 minutes and if the timer runs out, it will be a draw. Most of the maps also include some things that will activate after around 2 minutes of the match and the purpose of it is so that the players don't easily get a draw and they will have to meet some troubles at almost the end of the match. This was a description about what Gang Beasts is about. See you all next time!", 0.5], ["I've brought this game on my laptop to three parties now, mirroring the screen on a TV and playing with CRKD controllers.

Sure, it doesn't have the player base it used to by any means.

The wobbly physics, hilarious rag-doll brawling, and absurd levels made it an instant classic for couch co-op and online chaos. It was the kind of game you\u2019d throw on with friends and end up crying from laughter\u2014every fight was unpredictable, every win felt ridiculous, and that was the charm.\n\nBut over time, it started to lose its edge. While still fun in short bursts, it never really evolved. Updates were few and far between, and the mechanics\u2014while intentionally clumsy\u2014started to feel more frustrating than funny. The novelty wore off for a lot of players.\n\nThen Party Animals came along and basically did everything Gang Beasts does, but better. It kept the goofy physics and brawling chaos, but added smoother game-play, better polish, tighter controls, and more content right out of the gate. It\u2019s hard to go back to Gang Beasts after experiencing the faster pace and modern feel of Party Animals.\n\nAt this point, unless you\u2019re feeling nostalgic or just love the original art style and simplicity, there\u2019s not much reason to pick up Gang Beasts over Party Animals.
