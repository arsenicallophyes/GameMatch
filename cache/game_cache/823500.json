After my VR legs got a bit stronger, I came back and was absolutely blown away. I know this game came out some time ago now but I was finally able to experience it in all its glory.

Like, the physics, the graphics, the gameplay, the story, the creators, the soundtrack, the design, the characters\u2014everything about this game is amazing. I've played Bonelab before, but it is nothing compared to this game.\n\nI\u2019ve got 10.8 hours on it, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m even halfway done (probably because I\u2019m goofing around with the physics too much). And OMG, the sandbox? A M A Z I N G. It\u2019s so much fun\u2014it\u2019s like you\u2019re in real life, but you can do whatever you want.

A few months later, here I am with boneworks! I definitely think the campaign is better than bonelab's. I have to say, the puzzles are also more challenging and make you think. Thank you Stress Level Zero for developing this amazing game! Looking forward to the remaster!", 0.5], ["If i ever get asked the question, \"If you could play any game for the first time again, what would it be?\" It would easily be BONEWORKS, Boneworks is a phenomenal game, with so much rich story and lore I have a hard time understanding it half the time, its gameplay is very smooth (if you have a good connection lol) and the guns are amazing compared to other vr games guns, its gameplay is simple to understand with neat physics based movement and gameplay and an entire modding scene you can get into when you're done! The soundtrack is one of the best and most fitting with clean synthetic tracks mixed with old fantasy themed tracks. The next game, BONELAB mixes the dark fantasy and synthetic simulation themes together perfectly, I could do an entire second review on Bonelab but I don't own that on my steam account, shucks. ):", 0.5], ["super fun and easy to mod and play multy player", 0.5], ["Pioneer in game physics, future of VR, blah blah blah, go beat the void out of Ford", 0.5], ["good story and good cualaty", 0.5], ["Very interesting environments and a little less interesting puzzles and combat.\nThe gun physics and normal physics is satisfying.\nVery nice soundtrack.\n", 0.5], ["One of my favorite games now, very fun, physics are great, story is awesome, not *too* much of a challenge. 9.5/10 still better than Bonelab", 0.5], ["This game is pretty good but i can't say i love it.

It's just that, and exactly that. It's fine. \n\nIt does an awful lot of things, and none of them are going to wow you if you've played the likes of Blade and Sorcery, or HLAlyx. The melee is clumsy to the point of bare usability, the shooting is fine, but some guns aren't responsive for reloading, the puzzles require seconds of thought, and minutes of cumbersome manoeuvring. The story is... There. It's got some acting and voice acting, and even something like a plot, but it's forgettable. But despite all this mediocrity, it does boast an impressive collection of stuff, and that alone is worth something. I'm not sure what, but something. \n\nOverall, Boneworks is a game you get on a hefty sale, to add to your repertoire of \"fuck about\" games. It's repetitive and predictable, but fun nonetheless.\n\n6/10.", 0.4729729890823364], ["jack black should play ford in the movie/show adaptation when it comes out frfr ong", 0.52173912525177], ["Bro so good! i have beat the story twice and this game is amazing! my first game was bonelab and then i heard boneworks was thing I had to play it! 5/5!", 0.5]]}, "images": {"header_image": "https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/823500/header.jpg?t=1581381377", "capsule_image": "https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/823500/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1581381377", "capsule_image_v5": "https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/823500/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1581381377"}, "support": {"support_website": null, "support_email": null, "game_website": "http://www.stresslevelzero.com"}, "developer": "Stress Level Zero", "owners": "1,000,000 .. 2,000,000", "tags": ["VR", "Physics", "Action", "Sandbox", "Shooter", "Singleplayer", "Great Soundtrack", "Adventure", "Puzzle", "First-Person", "Simulation", "Realistic", "FPS", "Violent", "Indie", "Horror", "Parkour", "Sci-fi", "Gore", "Funny"], "languages": ["English"], "concurrent_plays": 49, "number_of_achievements": 16, "categories": ["Single-player", "Steam Achievements", "Tracked Controller Support", "VR Only", "Family Sharing"], "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie", "Simulation"], "short_description": "BONEWORKS is an Experimental Physics VR Adventure.
