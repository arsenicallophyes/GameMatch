The storyline is the weakest of the three, disjointed and inconsistent, making it hard to get into. But why do I still recommend this game even though it has the worst storyline in the trilogy? because of its improved gameplay, which I will discuss more in the \"Gameplay\" section. In my opinion, Mathias was the best antagonist in the trilogy. Konstantin was decent too. However, Dr. Dominguez felt underwhelming in comparison. I was hoping for a more intimidating villain, but it felt like a downgrade. They didn't change Lara's character model this time (which is a good thing), but the skin textures looked less detailed than [i]Rise of the Tomb Raider. [/i]On the upside, there's noticeable improvement in hair rendering. Camilla Luddington delivers a decent performance, but the dialogue occasionally feels weak.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThis game focuses more on exploration and has less combat compared to the previous one. Though I had fun exploring Peru, as the world-building and environment are gorgeous, and I believe they have been very consistent with it throughout the trilogy. It turns into horror for a bit, with an eerie atmosphere executed effectively. Combat mechanics are largely similar to the previous game, and I had fun taking the stealthy route. Lara can camouflage herself with mud, use fear arrows to turn enemies against each other and perform brutal stealth takedowns from trees or underwater. The expanded skill tree offers diverse playstyles, and weapon customisation remains robust. The best part of this game are the tombs, there are a total of 16 challenge tombs (including DLCs) in this game. They are more elaborate and challenging than [i]Rise of the Tomb Raider, [/i]often requiring players to engage with multiple mechanics and think critically to progress. The increased difficulty and depth of these puzzles offer a more rewarding experience. Additionally, the atmospheric design and the environmental storytelling contribute to a more immersive and engaging experience. [spoiler]\"Howl of the Monkey Gods\" was my personal favourite.[/spoiler]\n\n\n[h1]Downsides[/h1]\n\nWhile this game excels in atmosphere and exploration, the narrative execution was quite bad (as mentioned in the \"Overview\" section). Other than that, there's not much to talk about here, except some occasional texture pop-ins and camera glitches.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nPersonally, the trilogy could have ended in a better way.

I had seen reviews that this was the worst of the three, but had figured it would be fairly consistent with the other two regardless, but somehow, this game, which also builds on the platforming and combat of Rise while including more elements from the classic games, is a huge step down in quality.\r\n\r\nIn some ways it is consistent with the previous games. Platforming is about the same level of quality as in Rise, with extra focus on the grapple axe and the new additions of rappeling and overhead climbing. Precision jumping is still impossible, but the platforming is actually a nice diversion. Lara's combat moves are essentially the same as in Rise, with a dodge scramble, no being stuck behind cover, and unlockable new abilities like a Batman style takedown from tree branches, meaning the foundations for a fun shooter are there on the player's side. The setting and environments are also great, this game taking place in the Amazon, giving some great MGS3 jungle vibes, especially with changeable costumes and the ability to cover yourself in mud to aid in stealth. Graphically, the environments and art direction are very strong, though not every character model has the same love put into it, with Lara, Jonah, and Dominguez being obvious favourites.\r\n\r\nSo if the game has a better setting and the same core gameplay, what went wrong? Firstly, the stronger elements from the original game aren't followed through properly. Lara spends much of her time in Shadow exploring temples, shrines, a church, and at one point, even breaks into a Tomb, like the name of the game, but these are so simplistic and linear it begs the question of what the point really was. For the most part, puzzles were more complex in the previous two games, which already had highly simplified puzzles compared to the original, and there are no locked doors in any of them, just simple puzzles to progress to the next room, with no enemies in many of them. Some of these areas only require platforming to get through without any puzzle solving. It genuinely makes me wonder if the team had played the first Tomb Raider or not. In that game, Tombs take up whole levels and are filled with Zelda/Resident Evil style key hunting and puzzles that ask you to understand 3D space to navigate. Even the first Tomb in Tomb Raider 1 is more complex than the temples in Shadow, and it's made up of a handful of rooms, later tombs are sprawling behemoths to navigate. So yes, the inclusion of temples and shrines as part of the main plot in Shadow is welcome, but the execution is highly lacking. I understand that fans of the previous two games potentially would only play for the combat and be put off if this game suddenly forced them to complete Zelda style dungeons, but if the reasoning was to allow for more combat, I have more questions.\r\n\r\nCombat is the big elephant in the room, and it's time I addressed it. Shadow of the Tomb Raider fails to live up to the shooter gameplay of its predecessors because it simply doesn't have combat in it. I am of course exaggerating, there are some combat encounters here. But for over 5 hours, I did not come across a proper combat arena (excluding the Jaguar fight, meaning with human enemies) like in the first two games, and only a handful of small skirmish encounters, many of which were clearly scripted to allow one highly easy way through. In the early game, the stealth that was such a big part of approaching groups in the previous games also didn't seem to work; on one encounter, which I restarted multiple times to test this, I would wait until the Survivor Instinct told me a lone soldier was not being viewed by his comrades, then headshot him with the bow, a silent weapon, and every time I did this, every enemy in the area somehow knew exactly where I was and I had to play through the scenario as a shooter, without stealth, despite the game telling me stealth was possible. In fact, it wasn't until a story development where Lara lost all her weapons except for her knife that stealth seemed to work. After I got my weapons back, it gave me encounters where enemies permanently viewed one another and all wore helmets, rendering stealth impossible again. The game pretends to give you a wealth of options in approaching encounters, but really every encounter it has a set way it wants you to play. At the same time, enemy AI seems worse than in previous games, with enemies all just rushing you once they know where you are instead of using cover and forcing you to move around like in previous games most encounters. And after all this, there are only a few combat encounters in the whole game. The late game combat sections are like the early game sections from the first two. Half the time NPCs actually do the combat for you, such as in the Unuratu prison break section in which I killed two guards (who were positioned perfectly for stealth kills with no effort from me) and she killed the other four. Such a disappointment.\r\n\r\nIf the temples are watered down and there's no combat in it, all the game really has to grab you with is its story, which is really bad. It's essentially a retread of Rise's story, with Lara going up against Trinity, except this time it's the leader of Trinity and he actually has reasons for wanting to reshape the world, Lara finding a secret civilisation, there being ancient magical creatures to protect the plot macguffin (that you fight once in the whole game) and even an early game fight with wild animals. If the gameplay was actually existent, the plot would have been serviceable enough if a worse retread of the former game, but as it stands it just drags, and at a scene by scene level the writing can be summed up by one scene where Unuratu gives Lara a key and tells her to take it, they both walk down a corridor together, and at the end of that corridor Lara uses the key to open a door. Pointless. I did like the elements of Lara becoming a darker and more vengeful person, but they didn't commit to that, and that was also due to the actions of a guy who they build up as a major antagonist only for him to be killed in a cutscene by an NPC. It's weak stuff, and that's without even mentioning the number of obnoxiously long forced walking sections that suck all the joy out of some of the well crafted areas in the game like Paititi.\r\n\r\nIt's a shame because I like Tomb Raider and I wanted to like this one just as much as Rise, but the pacing and the actual balance of the gameplay itself is completely wrong.
