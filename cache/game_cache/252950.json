If you stuck with this game, REMATCH (yes the football game) is much better option and even its beta has more balanced matchmaking than this sh*thole.

The gameplay is fast-paced, exciting, and easy to pick up but hard to master. The cool cars add a unique twist to the classic soccer formula, making every match feel fresh and entertaining.\n\nWhat I love most is how quick the matches are \u2013 they keep the action nonstop, and there\u2019s no time wasted. The community is generally friendly, and I've had a lot of positive experiences with teammates, which makes the game even more enjoyable.\n\nIf you're looking for a fast, competitive, and fun game to play with friends (or solo), I highly recommend Rocket League.
