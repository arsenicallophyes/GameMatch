Everything about this game makes you happy. Everyone's always smiling (because your character can only smile), other players are extremely friendly (its totally normal for people to compliment you or congratulate you if you hit them in paintball), and the devs are just as feel-good as the game itself. They are extremely responsive to the community and really have a way of making everyone feel special. I sent Against Gravity an email recently, and the response I got came back less than six hours later not from some intern, but from the CEO. And in the AMA, when someone asked how they could support the company financially, the response was to instead to make a donation to charity and to \"tell 'em coach sent ya\". They're small gestures, but it really shows that they care.\n\n\nIn a world where it seems like we are constantly being bombarded with negativity, and where everyone is divided, this game is like a haven of positivity. Much like the reviews, the game itself is \"overwhelmingly positive\"", 0.7759674191474915], ["I have played many hours on many games in VR, rec room is by far my favorite game and I felt compelled to write a review. It's free, it's social, it has many mini games which are awesome and addictive. I can only hope they continue to build on the base game they have already because it is amazing.

It is challenging, but I did beat it 3 times \ud83d\ude0a\nPaintball: Endless fun.

That's the reason why all of the people from various countries are able to join here.\nUnfortunately, there are some children who can't understand about this diversity of people. \nSo, their behaviour to foreigners is extremely rude and nasty.\nThis is the reason why Rec Room should add warning of segregation on the dorm room just like sexual harassment. Additionally, it's not easy to kick them with the voting system.\nOne of my japanese friend did stop playing Rec Room because these kinds of problems.\nSo please make warnig of this matter, or please add segregation category in kicking system, and make a list of them.\nRec Room is really popular as the best VR Social Network game, these personal problems must be fixed if Rec Room need to remain for a long time.", 0.5], ["Some of the best VR experiences are free.\nThis is no exception.\nBest multiplayer in VR hands down.\nFriendly online community.\nEasy to get in and get out if you just want a quick play.\nA lot of Fun with real people.\nI would rather play paintball here than real life paintball.", 0.5], ["How is it that the best experiences I've had so far have been for free?

To my suprise, this has quickly become my favorite game not just for the HTC Vive, but my favorite game overall. With the new quest expansion, devs have shown this isn't going anywhere, and is only going to get better.\n\nI only hope now that they'll expand quest mode a bit.

But then again I suppose it's a good spot to chill if you're trying to avoid all the children.\n\nSpeaking of which, what parent gives their 8-year-old an $800 piece of sophisticated equipment to play with, anyway?
