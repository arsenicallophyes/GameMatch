That guys swears he hates this game, I think that hate is unjustified and he just needs to really try to enjoy it. it literally has EVERYTHING this guy likes about games, it is a fricken battle royale, puzzle, mini-games, survival, and strategy all in one. I think that he just thinks this is for kids, but I say this is perfect for all ages! I have never once had a bad experience while playing, and it even has its funny moments!

It can be so chaotic especially when you're getting pulled by everyone in the lobby, whilst at the same time being funny especially when you're with friends and you all get eliminated in the funniest ways. It's lighthearted but can also be competitive at times when you are just 2 cm away from qualifying, it has an overall good combination with different modes to play, the skins are okay. One annoying thing is that there is no chat option in game, hope they add that in the future to make it easier for friends with no mics. In addition to this, the camera angle is so annoying you cant look up towards to the sky which is a pain especially in modes like FallBall, hope they change this in the future too", 0.5089285969734192], ["Fortnite was The game for so long and I was so bad at it.

However it's still a solid game that provides easy entertainment (and a bit of \"rage\" sometimes if you're seriously playing haha). \r\nAlso, to the developers, could you please fix the Happy Birthday Crown and return it to those that had it? It's been gone since that glitch and it was like my favorite item ever. I used it probably 95% on my bean.
