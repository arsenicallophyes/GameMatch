I'm not really a gamer that should have tried this game.  My first game ever played was Hogwarts Legacy which was not only fun but was challenging to a new gamer.  But, Black Myth Wukong was a major step up and not a game for the casual player.  It will challenge you at every stage,  There are no easy levels and you will be required to conquer each level to move forward. But, oh! what a sense of  accomplishment when you beat the boss after 20 attempts.    You will find this game frustrating and fun at the same time with solid replay value.  I can't recommend this game any higher.", 0.7542126774787903], ["If you like Dark Souls/Elden Ring, you'll like this game - no doubt.\n\nI'd say it's Dark Souls' Chinese cousin, maybe even half-brother.", 0.7121127247810364], ["I am not the guy who wants to replay any game in New Game Plus mode. But this game changed my mind. A challenging journey it was, a tough one. The battles I fought were not the clean ones and I struggled in the first journey. But after completing the game, I am feeling like firing this game up on my handheld again and beating the crap out of the hard bosses who destroyed me. Let the challenge begin, AGAIN!\n\nP.S. Really loved the crap out of the GAME :)", 0.630948543548584], ["I have played every 'hit' game in the last 10 years. This one is easily top 3 for me, if not the best. There is nothing wrong about this game. This is truly the perfect game. Progression, gameplay, art direction, music, gearing, skills, story are all 10/10. Worth every penny, a must-play game. There is one small 'problem' that I need to say though. You can't turn off vignette, SSR and bloom. I like to play games with a plain look and the game can feel a bit oversharpened at the start. But the game is a literal art piece and looks beautiful so the lacking of those options aren't a big deal but still I wish I had the freedom to turn them off. Also I have played all FromSoft titles and this game is not as hard as those but not an easy game. The difficulty was perfect for a game like this. I can keep prasing this game forever but I will stop now.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3460182991", 0.5833333134651184], ["Graphics and Sound\nThe game looks absolutely beautiful. The visuals are top-notch, and the music and sound effects are just as impressive. Everything feels polished and high-quality in that department.\n\nContent\nThere\u2019s a lot to do here. The game offers 6 fairly long chapters, each packed with secrets and unique bosses. It definitely gives you a good amount of content for the price.\n\nExploration\nExploration is where things start to fall short. The world feels very limited\u2014there are invisible walls everywhere, which makes it feel like you're being pushed down a single path instead of really discovering anything. There's not much rewarding to find either, except for some low-quality herbs and places to meditate.\nThat said, each chapter does hide a big secret area, which is a nice surprise. But finding these areas isn\u2019t always intuitive\u2014you might miss them completely if playing blind without searching the internet.\n\nCombat\nCombat is the weakest part of the game. There\u2019s no button queuing, so if you press an attack button before your current animation finishes, the input gets ignored. This makes fights feel clunky and unresponsive.\n\nEnemy attacks often have strong tracking, while your own attacks don\u2019t. That means enemies can easily hit you, but if they move while you\u2019re swinging, your attacks often miss. It makes combat feel more about luck than skill sometimes.\n\nFighting normal enemies isn\u2019t very exciting either\u2014just charging a heavy attack before a fight is usually enough to take them out before they even get a hit in.\n\nBosses\nBoss design is hit-or-miss. While they\u2019re visually unique and creative, a lot of them are frustrating for the wrong reasons. Many main bosses have mechanics that feel cheap, like draining your stamina, messing with the camera, or blocking your vision. Instead of feeling like a fun challenge, these moments just come off as annoying.\n\nOverall Thoughts\nThe game isn\u2019t bad, but it\u2019s definitely overrated and overhyped. With better combat and exploration, it could\u2019ve been something really special. I just expected more. 7/10", 0.564152181148529], ["One very important thing about this game that I think you don't see when you watch videos on it is that the combat is very scripted and doesn't flow like other souls-like games. In other games of this genre, the combat has a very distinct flow that I personally just didn't get with this game. It felt like the only thing going for it in terms of combat was flashiness. Another thing I didn't enjoy was the movement. God, the movement in this game felt so restrictive, which is very prominent in most souls-like games, but the marketing for this game made it seem more like Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice when in reality you have much less freedom. One thing this game does have going for it is it's graphics. God this game is beautiful. While the combat isn't too good, the look of this game is amazing. The opening fight in this game felt so climactic and made me think this game was something special. Overall, if you've read this and seen all the trailers and still felt like this game is right for you, go buy it. It's obviously had so much work put into it by so many talented people, but I just felt like there were some things they weren't telling you", 0.5416666865348816], ["Black Myth: Wukong is an extraordinary achievement of China's video game industry, blending the legendary tale of one of the great Chinese novels and arguably the most popular literary work in East Asia, Journey to the West, with breathtaking gameplay. While it offers a challenging experience, it remains accessible, striking a perfect balance between difficulty and enjoyment.\r\n\r\nHowever, what truly sets it apart is its storytelling\u2014an exceptionally well-crafted narrative that rivals even the depth of a novel. Few games today reach such literary heights, making Black Myth: Wukong not just a great game, but a landmark in video game storytelling.\r\n\r\nTo fully appreciate the depth of its story, I highly recommend exploring Journey to the West, the classic masterpiece that serves as its foundation.

I was hesitant to try a souls-like game again but I decided to give it a try.\n\nI was glad this game blew away my expectations, as it wasn't as impossible as it was made out to be. The game was still a challenge but it was rewarding to overcome it. \n\nGame Science great job but please fix the issue with the PC port, I had constant issues with audio lag and desyncing in cutscenes and certain parts of the game(looks like others have had this issue but looks like there is no resolution for it).", 0.523809552192688], ["Marvelous game. The story is interesting to follow, all the cut scenes are beautifully animated, the soundtrack is incredible and authentic. The graphic is great as well, and the worlds are rich and saturated. \nSouls-like combat system, with variable skills and combinations, is perfect. Challenging but doable. The number of bosses is quite impressive. You face them regularly and most of them are unique.

But when I originally bought it I had a 10 year old PC and I couldn't run it on that old holding on by a thread PC. So I built the most Budget PC I could... After returning the game, because I needed every dollar I could get to get my new PC. I ended up building this new PC about a month ago, and still can't afford this game again...

If you\u2019ve got that Soulsborne itch, this will scratch it hard. Bosses are brutal, mobs don\u2019t pull punches, and yes\u2014you will die. A lot.

The frustration and anger turned into genuine learning with each victory.  \"get good\" is seriously the only advice i can give when fighting these bosses as the guides online vary with different styles of gaming.  Pick one that is most comfortable to you and perfect it.  There are bosses that will want you to hit your head against a wall (ESPECIALLY THE ENDING) but that sigh of relief after each grueling triumph was always worth it.  Overall, the game is a beautiful rendition of Journey to the West with breathtaking artwork and character designs.  The story is easy enough to get a basic understanding of what is happening (anything deeper, i recommend youtubing a lore video) and forces you to learn patience quickly.  There are a few game mechanics that are quite frustrating like 15 hit combos by the enemy and endless dodging making a fight longer than it should be.  Or some maps require excessive walking with no interaction but to see the sights while others are jam packed and sometimes overwhelming/confusing navigating the landscape.  This is of course subjective with my sense of direction haha.  At the end of the game, you are encouraged to play through again so replayability is high and rewarding as you work for the best gear in the game.  I would recommend this to any Dark Souls enthusiasts/players along with those experienced in intense gameplay.

Its reach and precision made it feel like I was dancing around enemies, striking with calculated jabs.
