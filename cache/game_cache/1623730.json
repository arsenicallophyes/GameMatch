Screw Nintendo for suing this company. They're only butthurt that someone made the Pokemon game that people have been wanting that wasn't them. They refused to allow the game to grow with the players or to make a more mature version of the game. I've made the decision to boycott Nintendo tbh. Anyway, this game is incredible. It's less like Pokemon and more like Ark with spheres that are used to catch the creatures in the game. What an incredible game. If you're on the fence about purchasing this game, you absolutely should just get it. Heck, I might gift it to you within reason. It's just that good.\r\n\r\n~Julia", 0.7119579911231995], ["With the newest update, the developers of this game added a EULA you now **must** consent to, lest you lose the ability to play the game you purchased in the past. This is EULA roofying at its finest (check out Louis Rossmann on YouTube for more information). They are retroactively changing the terms of the sale... after the sale. I do not support this, and though I loved this indie jam for defying the AAA space and all that, and though it breaks my heart to have to part with it, I cannot accept this exploitative consent-roofying, where they hold **your property that you purchased** hostage until you \"consent\" to a new EULA.\r\n\r\nGoodbye, Palworld. See you in hell, Pocket Pair.", 0.6185242533683777], ["Yeah, Idk. I wouldn't say I didn't enjoy it. It had its moments. However, as someone who prefers to play single player... this game felt janky. It had a lot of the components from other titles which, when combined, turned out to be pretty fun. You had Ark Survival, Pokemon, and LoZ:Botw mushed into a single game that provided a fairly unique experience.\n\nThe issue arises with everything beyond those core concepts:\n* The XP gain rates where out of sync with progression (Can be changed in server settings) \n* Build Area Limits felt frustratingly small (A build area that increases with base lvl would be nice)\n* End game grind is just tedious (Breeding, Blueprint farming, XP farming)\n\nNow I know I'm part of my own demise here, due to my stubbornness to tweak the server settings mid-playthrough... and yet I believe the game should have a preset scaling for single player. In my belief, with any open world game, you should only feel underleveled in a game if you rush the story. Rush the zones. Etc etc. LoZ BotW sort of treatment. In this game however, I had explored the entire map, gathering hundred of effigies, defeating every boss (some multiple times), and catching every single pal I knew existed... yet despite all this... I found that the lvl gap only creeped to be larger and larger. (I was at one point fighting enemies about 15 lvls above me, as I had nothing else left to do other then grind xp)\n\nI don't think the game is \"bad\", there is a lot of good in it. However, here are some adjustments I'd recommend (not tested personally)\n* Check out videos for a recommended (single player) world setting list.\n* Help yourself to the nexus mods page. There is plenty of mods out there, some addressing the issues I had.\n\nIn general, keep an eye out for anything that improves the breeding system, ensures a more fluent progression system, modifies the blueprint system, and enhances the building system. (If I ever go through the World Settings myself and determine what feels right to me, I'll update this. I'm open to suggestions if anyone can find a ideal progression system! The goal would be to hit lvl 60 the moment you've explored the full map, defeated every boss on the map, defeated the oil rigs, a little wiggle room for dungeons + predator pals, and finally defeated all the legendaries.)", 0.6047160625457764], ["Very good game. Enjoyed it a lot!\r\n\r\nin over 400 hours ive only had 1 crash, and that was after turning the game off, but it did not result in any data loss.\r\nThe building is fun and functional, there is a ton of different things you can build and style your buildings with. The Pal's you capture can run around your base planting, crafting, building things for you, Pal's have different skills of what theyre able to work with as well as different personality traits. Plenty of are useable as mounts and you can fight while riding. Some have other uses, like use a pal as a flamethrower by holding it for example.\r\n\r\nIf you ever see your pals being stuck / not moving, don't worry about it, they will haul, craft, eat and sleep on that spot until you get them unstuck, but theres no issue with them. (in rare occasions they might fall thru the world when you arent in base, and then just put them into the Palbox and let them heal and such.

This would be fine if the core gameplay loop was interesting... Unfortunately it just isn't.\n\nLong story short, it feels like this game lacks a lot of depth in every metric. Visually I find it uninspiring and uninteresting, AI feels extremely dull, fights are excessively repetitive, and overall the game feels empty. To me it very much seems like this game is just a remix of existing ideas and concepts, it doesn't feel innovative.\n\nI want to stress that I don't think Palworld is a bad game.

I dove in with no expectations, and realized that it is just not for me.", 0.5545348525047302], ["Its been about a year since the game launched and so far its still a buggy mess. The only thing added to the end game loop are \"oil rigs\" which are easily the most boring, terrible activity they could have possibly come up with. All the enemies have x-ray vision and aimbot, giga inflated health pools and damage. To make matters worse you can't even really use your pals because the pathing is broken and the Pal AI is dumb as rocks (not to mention the giant laser beam towers that will immediately turn to where your pal is and shoot them through a wall until dead). This would be fine if certain necessary items weren't locked behind this activity so you wouldn't have to do it. Everything else remains to be the same as before, terrible building, breeding pals is basically \"sit around and pray\", dungeons are still as boring as they were when the game launched (no seriously they haven't been changed one bit). \r\n\r\nThe general progression is \"get big gun, get strong pal, get even bigger gun and stronger pal\". Early game this works because the progression is so fast and you get stronger in bigger increments + you have a real reason to go out in the world and get random pals because they might roll with specific traits you want. Late game the only pals that matter are legendary pals that only have 1 spawn on the map and respawn every in-game. So all you do is just stand around and wait while the working pals make you stuff and you get to go and kill the same legendary pal every single in-game morning, get nothing, butcher said pal and get nothing AGAIN. Then you get to come back home, pick up whatever eggs have been dropped from the pals that are breeding, hatch those eggs into pals that almost guaranteed will disappoint you with traits that you definitely do not want, rinse repeat until eventually you get bored. Nothing has been added that gives you a reason to continue, a stick with no carrot if you will. Whatever that may exist takes way too damn long to even be ready to do let alone actually attempt.\r\n\r\nThis game is basically just a worse ark survival evolved but the difference between the 2 is that at the very least ark has built in console commands that I can use to rectify w/e spaghetti code just caused me to get fucked over. This game is NOT pokemon and the pokemon comparison makes no sense other than the pal designs being obviously inspired by pokemon.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse they have recently changed the EULA.
